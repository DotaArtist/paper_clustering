Methods: ANP cDNA was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which were encapsulated in polycarprolactone(PCL) tubes. The longterm survival of transfected CHO cells and the levels of ANP secreted were detected. Circadian rhythm of ANP secreted by encapsulated transfected cells was also studied, which was regulated by melatonin. Results: During culturing, the ANP level secreted by transfected CHO cells in 2 mL of culture medium within 24 hours could reach 210.3 ng/L in a 20 mm-long and 2 mm-diameter PCL tube. The section of ANP displayed a circadian variation: higher in daytime, but lower at night. The acrophase of circadian rhythm was 4: 15 but could be shifted to 7: 55 after melatonin management. Conclusion: ANP cDNA transfected CHO cells that encapsulated into PCL tube can secret ANP, which might be suitable for the future implantation into human body. Our research provides a new approach in the treatment of hypertension and CHF by ANP.',\n",

       " '9VmupIoc': {'abstract': \"The adaptation of the endogenous rhythm of an organism to external cycles may influence the development of physiological processes in animals. Light not only synchronizes the circadian system, but also exerts profound direct effects: the immediate reduction of melatonin release at night-time and the inhibition of locomotor activity in nocturnal rodents after a light pulse are well-known examples, yet little is known about effects of different light/dark (LD) cycles on the level of corticosterone, growth hormone and growth rate. Mice were raised under different period length of LD cycle including LD5:5 (light: 5 h; dark: 5 h), LD12:12 (light: 12 h; dark: 12 h) and LD16:16 (light: 16 h; dark: 16 h) for four weeks. Mice in LD5:5 and LD16:16 groups manifested higher locomotor activity, plasma corticosterone and growth hormone concentrations and growth rate than the LD12:12 group. The results suggest that different LD cycles may affect many physiological processes including growth rate, food intake and hormones, and the change of growth rate in different LD cycles may be related to the level of corticosterone and growth hormone concentrations. The results also suggest that both the long-period LD cycle and short-period LD cycles can improve the growth of mice, but they disturbed the biorhythm stabilization and affected hormone secretion; in general, these conditions would not promote the animals' survival. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.\",\n",

Chemical structures of the synthesized polymers were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) and Fourier transform infrared assay (FTIR) and molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The copolymers were processed into nanoparticles for delivery of paclitaxel (PTX). In this work, the PTX-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by the emulsion-solvent evaporation method, and the physicochemical properties and cytotoxicity were investigated. The particle sizes of nanoparticles determined by dynamic light scattering measurements were around 70\\xa0nm. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles were spherical in shape. The results of in vitro release tests showed that the release profiles of PTX-loaded nanoparticles had a sustained drug release pattern, and PTX release from nanoparticles at pH 5.8 was much faster than that at pH 7.4. The drug release profiles were also fitted for mathematical models to analyze the release mechanism, and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model was found to be the best fit model, indicating a combined effect of diffusion and erosion mechanisms for drug release. The cytotoxicity based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against human hepatic carcinoma HepG2 cells indicated that the GA-PEG-PBLA nanoparticles had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. These results indicated that the GA-PEG-PBLA nanoparticles could be a novel candidate for liver-targeted delivery of poorly water-soluble anticancer drugs.',\n",

       " 'dKTBlS35': {'abstract': 'Improving the cell penetration and enhancing the cell selectivity of drugs have been approved for overcoming the major drawbacks of chemotherapeutic agents: the toxicity to normal cells and the drug resistance in tumors. In this paper, lysine dendrimers (G1-G3) were chosen as novel cell-penetrating carriers for anti-cancer drugs based on the internalization mechanism of cell-penetrating peptides and the characteristics of dendritic peptides. After labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), the cell-penetrable capacity of lysine dendrimers was certified by flow cytometric analysis. In a preliminary biological evaluation, the conjugates of lysine dendrimers and 5-fluorouracil showed the expected advantages: stable drug release, low toxicity to normal cells, and moderate inhibition of tumor cells. These results imply that cell-penetrable lysine dendrimers could be potential carriers in drug delivery of anti-cancer medicine. Cell-penetrable lysine dendrimers (G1-G3) were evaluated as carriers for the model drug 5-fluorouracil. As expected, these prodrugs showed stable drug release, low cytotoxicity to normal cells, and moderate inhibition of tumor cells. The preliminary biological evaluation results imply that lysine dendrimers are potential drug carriers with effective translocation and reduced cytotoxicity for anti-cancer drug delivery. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The RGD-modified hybrid nanoparticles (RGD–lpNPs) could overcome the poor water solubility of Cur to meet the requirement of intravenous administration and tumor active targeting. The obtained optimal RGD-lpNPs, composed of PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))–mPEG (methoxyl poly(ethylene- glycol)), RGD–polyethylene glycol (PEG)–cholesterol (Chol) copolymers and lipids, had good entrapment efficiency, submicron size and negatively neutral surface charge. The core-shell structure of RGD–lpNPs was verified by TEM. Cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that the RGD–lpNPs encapsulated Cur retained potent anti-tumor effects. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the cellular uptake of Cur encapsulated in the RGD–lpNPs was increased for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Furthermore, Cur loaded RGD–lpNPs were more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor model. The results of immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical studies by Cur loaded RGD–lpNPs therapies indicated that more apoptotic cells, fewer microvessels, and fewer proliferation-positive cells were observed. In conclusion, RGD–lpNPs encapsulating Cur were developed with enhanced anti-tumor activity in melanoma, and Cur loaded RGD–lpNPs represent an excellent tumor targeted formulation of Cur which might be an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.',\n",

The scFv46 fragment could enhance the resistance of ASNase to trypsin proteolysis, with 70% of the initial ASNase activity present after the ASNase-scFv46 complex had been treated with trypsin for 30 min at 37°C, whereas little residual activity was detected without the scFv46 fragment. The scFv46 gene was cloned to an expression vector pET-21a and expressed at high levels (about 45% of total cell protein) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies. The refolded and purified scFv46 fragment was proved to protect ASNase, and the protective effect was further confirmed by SDS/PAGE. It was found that under optimum conditions of molar ratio of scFv to ASNase, incubation time and temperature, the residual activity of the AsNase-scFv46 complex could reach about 78% after treatment with trypsin for 30 min at 37°C. The results demonstrated that scFv fragments prepared by phage-antibody library technology could be used to protect target proteins.',\n",

Methods: A case-control research was done in 31 cases of AIDP, 33 cases of AMAN and 132 health individual controls. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by improved fast saltingout. HLA-A, B antigens were typed by DNA-based technology, PCR-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method. In determination of allelic pelymorphism by PCR amplification with SSP, oligonucleotide primers are designed to obtain amplification of specific alleles or groups of alleles. Assignment of alleles is based on the presence or absence of PCR amplified product, which may be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: On research of HLA-A, B alleles polymorphism, it showed that HLA-A33 frequency was increased significantly in AIDP patients [22.6% vs 4.5%, corrected probability (Pc) = 0.011]; related risk (RR) was 6.1; HLA-B15, B35 frequencies were increased (51.7% vs 20.8%, Pc = 0.015; 34.5% vs 6.9%, Pc = 0.000 8); RR was 4.1 and 7.1, respectively.

First of all, a rational representation for integrated features by virtue of complex vectors is given, i.e., two sets of feature vectors of a same sample are combined together by a complex vector. As a result, the feature space becomes a complex vector space rather than a real one. Then, to solve the problem of feature extraction in the integrated complex vector space, the theory of the complex uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA) is developed. Based on this theory, a generalized ULDA method is proposed. This method is suitable for feature extraction in the complex integrated feature space. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is tested on Concordia University CENPARMI handwritten digit database and NUST603HW handwritten Chinese character database built in Nanjing University of Science and Technology. The experimental results indicate that after feature extraction using the proposed method, the recognition accuracy is increased significantly as well as the dimension of feature vector is reduced largely.

The key issues in FE modeling of long-span bridges for health monitoring and condition assessment has been studied by our group for several years. The FE models of the Tsing Ma Bridge (TMB) in Hong Kong and Runyang Yangtse Bridge (RYB) in Jiangsu have been developed respectively for the purpose of structural health assessment and installation of a structural health system on RYB. The result shows that the model for the purpose of health assessment should be developed on the basis of transition theory for linking elements between local-scale at material points and full-scale at the structural level. Model updating and validation are necessary for an accurate modeling of the complicated bridge structures. Some critical components are determined from the analysis of the structural response by using the FE model of TMB in full-scale, then the local FE models are developed and used to determine the behavior of hot-spot stress and fatigue accumulation at critical locations.',\n",

However, the wide application of MaPPM is only possible with the advent of high-performance parallel computers. The great size gap between solid particle and pseudo-particle makes MaPPM different from MD simulations during the parallelization process, which is the specialty and difficulty in this paper. The domain decomposition method is used in the parallel algorithm because of the great number of pseudo-particles in particle-fluid systems. The algorithm is also improved according to the specialty in MaPPM to reduce computation cost. The computation is conducted on COW (cluster of workstations) with different system sizes and various numbers of processors to test its performance. Computation results indicate that the new algorithm has high parallel efficiency and good scalability. The parallel implementation will help to make use of MaPPM in large-scale simulations of two-phase flow.',\n",

At 1.2kb/s the MELP parameters for three consecutive frames are grouped into a super-frame and vectors are jointly quantized to obtain high coding efficiency. Besides fractional pitch and pitch doubling check, a sliding pitch analysis window method is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy of pitch detection. Dynamic bit allocation is used according to different U/V modes of super-frames so as to reduce bit rate as well as improve speech quality. Subjective listening test results indicate that the speech quality of this algorithm is close to the existing federal standard 2.4 kb/s MELP coder.',\n",

Its main idea is that wavelet transform is first employed to preprocess the original training images before the nonlinear mapping and three groups of wavelet features: lowest frequency subimage, horizontal detail and vertical detail, are derived respectively. What follows, Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) is performed on three classes of wavelet features. Three final discriminant feature vectors are obtained, from which a feature fusing method is developed. Finally, the experimental results on ORL face databases indicate that the proposed method is more effective than the current KFDA. And, more importantly, its consumed time in feature extraction is only one thirteenth of that of KFDA. Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate that this method is robust in uncontrolled lighting condition.',\n",

The fatigue damage evolution curves of the welded specimens were obtained by investigating the system frequency changes. The results show that the total fatigue life of the welded specimens are composed of two parts, the life corresponding to fatigue crack initiation and growth, being about 90% of the total life, and the period of fatigue crack propagation, being only 10% of the total life.

In this paper, a parallel algorithm for macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling based on spatial decomposition (SD) is presented. The parallel implementation utilizes MPI as the programming environment. Due to movement of particles during simulation, the parallelization of MaPPM may suffer from load imbalance and attendant performance degradation. Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) is adopted to partition the whole computational domain in a dynamic fashion to balance the workload in processors. The Shift scheme is modified to meet the communication requirement in the dynamic partition. The parallel approach was applied to simulation of bubble behavior in gas-solid fluidized beds with different system sizes to test its performance. The computations were conducted on cluster of workstations (COW). Experimental results show that the algorithm has a good scalability. With dynamic load balancing (DLB), the parallel efficiency can be improved by up to 8%. To sum up, it was a successful implementation for the parallelization of macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

Based on the circuit models of a power system and the theory of manifold transversality, the saddle-node bifurcation point is corresponding to the non-transversal intersection between the solution manifolds of injection equations and the linear network equations in the space spanned by the bus voltage and the injection current. This research studies the characteristics of the two solution manifolds and gives an algorithm based on the Newton algorithm for getting the non-transversal point, and it also can calculate the transversal point. © 2005 IEEE.',\n",

As more and more filtering queries are registered in high-speed data stream management system, the processing efficiency becomes crucial. This paper presents an efficient query index structure based on decision tree. The index structure makes full use of predicate indices on single attributes, as well as the conjunction relationship between predicates in a single query. It is easy to integrate various predicate indices into this structure. How to select dividing attributes during construction is crucial to the performance of the index tree. Two dividing attribute selection algorithms are described. One is based on information gain (IG) and the other is based on estimated time cost (ETC). The latter takes some sample tuples as a training data set and is able to build more efficient trees. Our experiments demonstrate that. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.',\n",

The main experimental parameters include different levels of sustaining load at the time of strengthening and load history. To explain the experimental results in quantitative terms, a theoretical model for flexural behavior of the strengthened reinforced concrete beam is also developed. Test results in the current study show that sustaining load levels at the time of strengthening have important influence on the ultimate strength of strengthened reinforced concrete beams.

To analyze the change of platelet active factor (PAF)-platelet membrane glycoprotein in the production and development of cerebrovascular disease and further discover the relationship between them and promote the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Data sources: The Medline database was searched for articles on the relationship of PAF and cerebrovascular disease published from January 1990 to December 2004 with the key words of \"Platelet activation, Platelet glycoprotein, Cerebral arterial thrombosis, Atherosclerosis\" in English, and the observational subjects were human. Meanwhile, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was also searched for literatures about blood platelet activation with cerebral arteriosclerosis and cerebral thrombosis published between January 1994 and December 2004 in Chinese with the key words of \"platelet membrane glycoprotein, cerebral arteriosclerosis, cerebral infarction\". Study selection: The data were selected firstly, and the literatures accorded with criteria were included, and then the full-texts were searched. Inclusive criteria: 1 Original work about structure, detective principle and how to work of platelet membrane glycoprotein in the process of blood platelet activation. 2 original work of quantitative detection of platelet membrane glycoprotein on diagnosis and prevention of cerebrovascular disease. Exclusive criteria: articles with repetitive research and literatures on other kinds of platelet membrane glycoprotein that had no relation with this study. Data extraction: Totally 64 literatures about detection of PAF and its relationship with cerebrovascular disease were collected. Articles with repetitive research or without study of platelet membrane glycoprotein were excluded. Nineteen papers were included, which composed of 3 articles on the structure and detective principle of platelet membrane glycoprotein, 1 paper on the relationship between blood platelet activation and cerebral arteriosclerosis, 12 literatures on the relationship between PAF and cerebral thrombosis, 1 article on the relationship between blood platelet activation and cardiovascular disease and 2 papers on application of receptor antagonist of platelet membrane glycoprotein. Data synthesis: The blood platelet activation played an important role in the process of onset and development of cerebrovascular disease. Because of the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, the factor accelerated the activation of blood platelet could not inverse, which made the blood platelet in the activated status for a long time. Clinical anticoagulation could decrease the activation of blood platelet to some degree, but could not eliminate fully the effect of factors inducing activation. The platelet membrane glycoprotein of activated blood platelet changed significantly as compared with the quiescent blood platelet, and expressed in a large number in blood platelet membrane, and became a molecule marker of activated blood platelet. With the profound study of molecular biology of platelet membrane glycoprotein and the clarification of molecule mechanism of thrombosis, the synthesis of receptor antagonist of new-type blood platelet membrane would instead or compensate the effects of aspirin and suppository, and promote the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Conclusion: The activation of blood platelet plays an important role in thrombotic diseases. Thus, the study of activation of blood platelet as an early factor of thrombosis and infarction in cerebral vessels as well as exact determination of GP II b/III a, GP I b and GMP-140-its activated marker have crucial significance on detection of diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic efficacy of the onset of cerebrovascular disease.',\n",

We find that Load/Store functional unit within processor can make one bottleneck of protocol processing performance, and for stateful protocol processing thread has stronger cache contention capability when in connection building phase. This paper presents a new parallelism strategy, breaking the protocol finite state machine into sub-machines according to the performance characters of different state phases and running the sub-machines concurrently in logic processors. Simulation results show that this strategy can make threads use shared cache more friendly and obtain more performance improvement in SMT architecture.

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and Maximum Entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.',\n",

The multi-scale finite element modeling was first studied by using substructure method and the multi-point constraints. A multi-scale model of Tsing Ma Bridge (TMB) was then developed by using the design drawings and the proposed strategy on the basis of the software ABAQUS and the developed programs via the user interface. The model updating and verification were carried out based on the online data from the structural health monitoring system installed on TMB. The procedure for damage analysis using the developed model was proposed, in which locally deteriorating process at welded details of interconnects is able to account for the major effect of the damage and nonlinear influence on structural response. The calculated result shows that damage features can be successfully performed via multi-scale modeling and analysis; and fatigue damage accumulation on the weld details shows significantly local effect. The fatigue life obtained from the fully coupled calculation on stress and damage is shorter than that from the uncouple computation, which suggests that the significant interaction between the damage and the structural response should be considered in the structural damage analyses using the multi-scale numerical analysis.',\n",

It has also been claimed that this polymorphism may affect TNFα expression. We investigated the TNFα -308 polymorphism and TNFα levels in 79 unrelated Chinese patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and 78 healthy controls using PCR-RFLP and ELISA assay. Patients with GBS were divided into 2 subgroups, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), based on electrophysiological information. We found that the TNFα2 allele was associated with increased risk of GBS (OR = 1.876, 95% CI = 1.144-3.075, p = 0.008), particularly for AMAN, the main subtype (OR = 2.914, 95% CI = 1.412-6.015, p = 0.004), but there was no association between TNFα polymorphism and AIDP. We also found that carriers of the TNFα2 allele had significantly higher TNFα2 levels than TNFα1 homozygotes (p < 0.05). These data indicate that TNFα promoter polymorphism is responsible for susceptibility to GBS, especially to AMAN. The TNFα2 allele is associated with higher levels of TNFα. Copyright © 2007 S.

This algorithm aims to minimize the control cost while recovering the feasibility of the power flow. The recovering process is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem which is solved in two steps, restoring solvability and restoring feasibility. The optimal load shedding method is used to regain power flow solutions under specified contingencies, while a modal analysis is made to determine the participation factors of each bus related to the key instability mode. These participation factors are used to determine a priority list for the optimal power flow tool to minimize the load shedding and re-dispatch of the active/reactive power generation.

The simulation results show that the modal analysis has reduced the dimensions of the problem and improved the converging speed, which is important for on-line real-time control.',\n",

Moreover, the authors introduce active learning method to select the most qualified data for training and thus assist TCM-KNN effectively in fulfilling the intrusion detection task. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method has better results both in detection rate and false positives than the state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods. The method can also ensure good detection performance after optimizations by using instance selection and feature selection mechanisms.

Two Matrix-based Fast Calculation Algorithms (MFCAs) are proposed to estimate the network capacity in a network scenario in which there is no channel sharing among multiple sessions and traffic is sensitive to delay with an end-to-end delay constraint. The first algorithm MFCA-1 is used to estimate network capacity in a situation where all links have the same delay. It estimates the maximum number of κ-hop sessions in a network based on the κ-hop adjacency matrix of the network. The second algorithm MFCA-2 is used to estimate network capacity in a situation where different links may have different delays. It calculates the maximum number of sessions in a network with an end-to-end delay constraint based on the adjacency matrix and the link-delay matrix of the network. Numerical and simulation results show that both MFCA-1 and MFCA-2 can calculate network capacity much faster than the well-known Brute-Force Search Algorithm (BFSA) but with the same accuracy. © 2007 Science Press.',\n",

To reduce the over-segmentation of toboggan, a merging method of regions is carried out after toboggan segmentation according to their areas and similarities.

In the field of graphics there is a technique called graph cut, which can be used to figure out the contour of object under the interaction of users. The graph cut algorithm can be used to verify the correctness of object region extraction, and the users' input about seeds can be simulated according to the initial object region extracted. The usage of graph cut can make the object region extracted more precisely and thus the performance of image retrieval based on object region can be improved.

We now present a blind MUD based on improved subspace tracking algorithm that we believe can reduce considerably computational complexity while keeping satisfactory convergence speed and stability unchanged. In the full paper, we explain the blind MUD in some detail; in this abstract, we just add some pertinent remarks to listing the two topics of explanation. The first topic is: The modified model of minimum mean square error (MMSE) MUD. In this topic, we point out that the modified model reduces the errors caused by subspace estimation and improves the detection performance of the blind MUD. The second topic is: The improved subspace tracking algorithm based on power iteration. In this topic, we present the iteration process of the algorithm to obtain the main signal subspace, as given in eqs. (11) through (19) in the full paper. The algorithm with power iteration has global convergence while reducing computational complexity considerably. Finally we simulate our algorithm in comparison with the OPAST algorithm. The simulation results, shown in Figs. 1 and 2 in the full paper, demonstrate preliminarily that our algorithm converges much faster and its stability is better than the OPAST algorithm and that its MMSE is much lower than that of OPAST algorithm, while keeping the computational complexity unchanged. The simulation results thus verify the effectiveness of the blind MUD.',\n",

The solution structure and DNA-binding surface of Cren7 from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus were determined by NMR. The protein adopts an SH3-like fold. It interacts with duplex DNA through a β-sheet and a long flexible loop, presumably resulting in DNA distortions through intercalation of conserved hydrophobic residues into the DNA structure.

Six types of edge and six prototype vectors are defined, among them the latter are taken as inputs into SOM to classify the edge types and then obtain edge images from which the speckled edges are removed to acquire ideal edge images.

In this paper, based on multi-scale morphology algorithm is proposed to detect the edge of brain MRI with Gaussian and salt & pepper noise. Threshold is to classify the MRI into two opposite classes: object and background. The part which is larger than the threshold uses large-scale structure element to detect the edge, and uses small-scale structure element for the part less than the threshold. Large-scale structure element gets through small-scale structure element's dilation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient for medical image denoising and edge detection than the usually used gradient-based edge detecting algorithms. © 2007 IEEE.\",\n",

The study of parameter optimization of damping control for poorly damped oscillations by combining genetic algorithm (GA) with damping assessment in a time-domain program simulation was carried out. The objective function for GA takes damping ratio as its variable. Test results for both 6-machine-dual-infeed HVDC and 50-machine-145- bus systems show that the algorithm extracts key information from multi-machine oscillations correctly; damping ratio is an effective index for evaluation of damping control effect; coordinated damping control based on information aforementioned provides good damping torque to oscillations after fault and improves system large-signal dynamic performance apparently.',\n",

Experimental evaluations both from the contrast experiment and the prototype based on UBSF demonstrate it can significantly raise the filtering accuracy, effectively reduce false positives and can be applied to online process and heavy traffic environment by reducing the computational cost than the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2008 IEEE.',\n",

       " 'Cm69vhO7': {'abstract': 'The aim of this study was to establish an animal model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and examine the basic pathological changes, as well as expression and distribution of MMP-2 and MMP-9, in Wistar rats. Tissue sections were processed for HE staining, Weil myelin staining, and modified Bielschowsky staining. Expression and distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were detected with immunohistochemistry. We divided the EAE into five types, depending on pathological characteristics and clinical manifestations: acute EAE, relapsing-remitting EAE, progressive EAE, benign EAE, and asymptomatic EAE. Rats with acute EAE suffered from quick, severe attacks with widespread inflammatory cells and axonal loss. No demyelination or astrocytic hyperplasia was found around the lesions. Rats with relapsing-remitting EAE broke down twice, with many perivascular cuffs and demyelinating plaques in lesions; hyperplastic and hypertrophic astrocytes characterized old lesions and axonal loss was evident. Rats suffering from progressive EAE exhibited continuous aggravation without improvement, accompanied by perivascular cuffs, demyelination, increased gliocytes and axonal damage. Rats with benign EAE recovered to a normal state with obviously decreased inflammatory cells and almost entirely unaffected myelin and axons. Rats with asymptomatic EAE also had various pathological changes that were not coincident with their clinical manifestations. Elevated expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was concordant in different types of EAE, but the extent differed in each type of EAE. MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be expressed in the form of vascular endothelial cells, meninges, or accumulated inflammatory cells. Multiple clinical courses of disease were demonstrated in Wistar rat EAE, with attributes similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinical and pathological characteristics. Elevated expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 may play a role in some aspects of pathological changes in EAE, for example, destroying the blood-brain barrier, degrading the myelin sheath, and damaging axons. © The Authors 2008.',\n",

Results showed that the transparency of gelatin-immobilized chitosan film could reach 98% or so, which could meet the requirement of optical transmittance in corneal regeneration. After the surface modification, water absorption percentage increased to 97.6%, while the contact angle declined to 73.4°, the hydrophilicity was improved and the biocompatibility could be enhanced. Results of culturing human fibroblasts on the gelatin-immobilized chitosan film showed that cells could adhere and proliferate well on the film, it exhibited good cell affinity. The gelatin-immobilized chitosan film was compatible with human fibroblasts which indicated that the gelatin-immobilized chitosan film could be a potential biomaterial for corneal regeneration.',\n",

When micro-turbine-based synchronous generators are used as the main power support, the frequency of MicroGrid fluctuates greatly, and some DGs are disconnected from the grid by the low frequency relays, which is not beneficial to stable operation of the MicroGrid. After increasing storage devices, the storage devices play an important role in MicroGrid control, and the inverter of battery using droop control could provide fast power support for the islanded MicroGrid, and can damp the voltage and frequency fluctuations caused by the slow dynamical response of gas turbine efficiently.

The structure of films was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and zeta potential. Results confirmed that hyaluronic acid was successfully immobilized on chitosan film. Transparency, water absorption percentage and contact angle of films were characterized. Results showed that there was no significant variation in transparency (p < 0.05) before and after immobilization, the maximum was up to 99% which was enough for corneal regeneration in clinical applications. After the immobilization, the time-dependent contact angle declined sharply (from 91.8° to 67.7° at 100 s). The hydrophilicity was significantly improved. The methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to assess cell viability and proliferation. Results showed that human cornea epithelial cells (HCEC) grew better on hyaluronic acid immobilized chitosan films than on chitosan films.

Sso pol B1 showed replication fidelity similar to or higher than most viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic replicases. The fidelity of the enzyme was about three times as high at 70°C as at 55°C. Approximately two-thirds of the errors made by the enzyme were single-base substitutions, of which 58% were C → T transition. Frameshift mutations, mostly resulting from single-base deletions, accounted for 19% of the total errors. An exonuclease-deficient mutant of Sso pol B1 was three times as mutagenic as the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the intrinsic proofreading function contributed only modestly to the fidelity of the enzyme. Kinetic assays showed that the frequencies of all possible misincorporations by an exonuclease-deficient triple-point mutant of Sso pol B1 ranged from 5. 4 × 10',\n",

The temperature could rise to about 800C at the wheel velocity of 160 m/s. The enhanced resistance of the air barrier formed around the wheel periphery at the higher velocity to the coolant supply was mainly responsible for the temperature rise. When the grinding forces and temperatures are considered comprehensively, high wheel speed and large depth of cut are preferable for the wet HSDG of engineering ceramics under low workpiece feed rate.

This paper presents a new method that makes the resulting image quality much improved, by mending the resampling values used during the process of image compositing, nearly not affecting the efficiency of rendering. In this method, two adjacent slices are defined as front slice and back slice respectively, according to the direction of the viewing ray. A cost function is defined for describing the two adjacent slices ' effect to the slab between them. The values of the resampling points in the front slice and back slice are inputted to the cost function as its parameters, and the resulting value can reflect the information of the slab more effectively. Compositing this resulting value as resampling value will improve the image quality significantly, and overcome the drawback of imagealiasing in the traditional shear-warp algorithm. © 2009 IEEE.\",\n",

Our calculation results show that the graphene layers turn into periodic corrugations and there exist strong chemical bonds in the interface between the graphene N × N superlattice and the substrate.

The algorithm is inspired by the researches of neurophysiology, which have revealed that the response of a central stimulus in the receptive field is affected by its surrounding stimuli. The measure firstly simulates the response function of the visual cell by researching into the structure of the primary visual cortex. And then, a new neighboring effect term is proposed to characterize the interactions of surrounding cells. The term balances different effects of the surrounding stimuli based on considering the distance, position and orientation of the stimulus; moreover, normalized computational model reduces computational complexity effectively. Finally, two tests are implemented to verify the feasibility and the stability of the proposed detection model. The experimental results show that our measure is superior to other methods and effectively detects contours in a clutter background.

It is necessary to construct a main memory-based query index with a low storage cost and little search time. The CEI index structure has low storage utilization, although it supports for high-speed query. To solve this problem, index structure ACEI is proposed. Based on CEI, through structural adjustment and optimization of parameters, ACEI can maintain the high speed of query operation and reduce the space complexity from O(R+N·W/L+N·log(L)) to O(sqrt(R·N)+N·sqrt(W)).

As the pattern set size grows larger and larger, classical multiple string matching algorithms suffer from great performance degradation because of the massive storage usage of string matching automata. The authors propose optimization strategies for the classical string matching algorithm SBOM to reduce its automata size and improve its cache locality, which results in a great promotion in searching speed. More specifically, the Factor Oracle of SBOM algorithm is first replaced with a suffix tree structure, and then the rarely accessed automata nodes are removed through the pruning method to reduce suffix tree to nearly linear space complexity, and finally the pruned suffix tree is represented with double-array trie structure to compress its memory space. Compared with SBOM, this algorithm can greatly reduce memory usage and improve searching speed. Experiments on random data sets show that the proposed algorithm uses memory less than 5% of SBOM and achieves 100% performance improvement over SBOM algorithm. The proposed algorithm is especially suitable for high-speed online pattern matching.\",\n",

Previous studies have explored miRNA evolutionary trend, but evolutionary history and pattern in the miRNA world are still not fully clear. In the paper, we intended to analyze miRNA haplotype distribution and evolutionary network by analyzing miRNA sequences of miR-17 and miR-124 families across animal species as special populations. Principal Findings: 31 haplotypes were detected in miR-17 family while only 9 haplotypes were defined in miR-124 family. The complex miR-17 family was mainly distributed in vertebrates, but miR-124 was shared by more animal species from Caenorhabditis to Homo and had a wide distribution spectrum. Some haplotypes of the two miRNA families appeared discontinuous distributions across animals. Compared with a simple phylogenetic network in miR-124 family, miR-17 family indicated a complex network with some median vectors that might be lost ancestral or potential miRNA haplotypes. By analyzing different miRNAs across 12 animal species, we found these small RNAs showed different haplotype diversities, haplotype distributions and phylogenetic networks. Conclusions: Different miRNAs had quite different haplotype distributions and evolutionary patterns. Discontinuous distributions of miRNAs and median vectors in phylogenetic networks implied more members in the miRNA world. miRNA may be an excellent phylogenetic marker to discover its evolutionary history and pattern across the animal kingdom. © 2009 Guo et al.',\n",

Methods: The EAE model was established in wistar rats immunized with fresh guinea pig spinal cord homogenate(GPSCH) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups: normal control group, EAE group, dexamethasone(DXM) group, low dose TP-5 treated group, high dose TP-5 treated group. The levels of IL-12 and IL-10 in serum of wistar rats were detected by sandwich-ELISA on day 7, 14 and 21 post immunization. Results: Morbidity and clinical score of low dose TP-5 treated group and DXM group were significantly lower than those of EAE group and hish dose TP-5 treated group(P < 0.01). Morbidity and clinical score of DXM group were significantly lower than those of low dose of TP-5 treated group(P < 0.01). The levels of IL-12 of EAE group, DXM group, low dose TP-5 treated group and high dose TP-5 treated group were significantly higher than of normal control group at each time point(P < 0.01).

Firstly, the operating modes of MT are introduced briefly. Then operating characters and influence on traditional system protection are analyzed while MTs are connecting to the grid. The different dual mode schemes are compared via simulating different 10 kV line fault cases. Simulation results indicated that type II MT connected with grid via synchronal generator supplied larger short-circuit current, as well as worse influence on superior protection and equipment-selecting than those of type I MT which is connected with grid by converter. Further more, although type II MT can realize seamless transition, type II MT needs more strict mode transform condition than type I does, such as needing to coordinate the protection settings of turbine and system, and a braking resistance box should be used when MT is changing operating mode from grid connected (GC) mode to stand alone (SA) mode. While being grid-connected, type II MT is prone to be effected by other 10 kV lines fault. Contrarily, although type I turbine can not transform seamlessly, it has little influence on superior system protection and switchgear-selecting, as well as supplying low short circuit current.',\n",

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference.

In each extended instruction, some shadow-f registers are introduced to provide a copy of results received in the write-back stage, which can efficiently reduce the time of data transfer between LEON-2 and the coprocessor. Analysis of our proposed architecture shows that only partial replication of the whole register file is needed to mitigate the bandwidth limitation.

Finally, we can obtain an estimation of the separating matrix and output signals. Comparing with the classical BSS methods based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), this approach set less constraints on the source signals, such as stationarity and independence.

The protein shows higher affinity for double-stranded DNA than for single-stranded DNA, constrains negative DNA supercoils in vitro and is associated with genomic DNA in vivo. Here we report the crystal structures of the Cren7 protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus in complex with two DNA sequences. Cren7 binds in the minor groove of DNA and causes a single-step sharp kink in DNA (∼53°) through the intercalation of the hydrophobic side chain of Leu28. Loop β3-β4 of Cren7 undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding of the protein to DNA, suggesting its critical role in the stabilization of the protein-DNA complex. The roles of DNA-contacting amino acid residues in stabilizing the Cren7-DNA interaction were examined by mutational analysis. Structural comparison of Cren7-DNA complexes with Sac7d-DNA complexes reveals significant differences between the two proteins in DNA binding surface, suggesting that Cren7 and Sul7d serve distinct functions in chromosomal organization. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.',\n",

It is shown that the landing epoch (the emission epoch of the last signal) of CE-1 satellite on the Moon was at UTC8h13m6.51s. The lunar longitude, latitude and surface height of the landing point in the lunar primary axes frame are respectively 52.2732°, 1.6440° and -3.56 km (the reference lunar radius is 1738 km). The uncertainties are 0.0040°, 0.0168° and 0.18 km. The corresponding uncertainty in the tangential direction of the lunar surface is 0.52 km and the three-dimensional (3D) positioning uncertainty is 0.55 km. It is accordingly deduced that even with the present technical specifications of the radio ranges and VLBI delays, the 1 km 3D positioning precision could be guaranteed for the lander in the second stage of China's Lunar Exploration Project. Concerning the trace determination of the rover on the lunar surface, because only telemetry signal will be emitted, VLBI would be the sole tracking technique from the Earth. The application of the constraint of geocentric distance is shown to be helpful to improving the positioning precision. It is worthy to pay close attention to the applications of the same beam VLBI technique, the lunar topographic model and the on-board observations of the lander and rover to the position/trace determination of the rover. © Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2010.\",\n",

Some divergence was observed between expression distributions based on sequence count of the most abundant isomiR and sum of all isomiR sequence counts, respectively. But the divergence showed less effect on expression patterns in miRNA gene cluster and family. Because of high sensitivity of sequencing technology and ambiguous distribution of common isomiRs among multicopy miRNA precursors and homologous genes, most gene clusters and families showed inconsistent expression levels. Inconsistent expression pattern implied expression diversification in vivo although they maybe showed close relationship during transcription and/or gene regulation. Some gene clusters and families generated mature miRNAs from the same arms and even with the same lengths, especially in gene family. The interesting expression and length distribution maybe implied strict regulation during pre-miRNA processing through cleavage of Dicer and Drosha.

Similar expression pattern of miRNA cluster was detected by analyzing the most abundant isomer and multiple isomiRs, respectively. According to all the multiple isomiRs, miRNA* species always had fewer sequence counts and indicated different expression patterns with their miRNAs. Although co-transcribed from a single promoter as a single polycistronic transcript, miRNAs in gene cluster showed distinct levels. Inconsistent expression levels also could be detected after normalization of sequence counts despite degree of divergence was largely reduced. The difference of expression pattern might result from miRNA half-life because of degradation degree and rate.

Recently, some miRNA* sequences were reported as guide miRNAs with abundant expression. Here, we intended to discover evolutionary implication of the fate of miRNA* strand by analyzing miRNA/miRNA* sequences across vertebrates. Principal Findings Mature miRNAs based on gene families were well conserved especially for their seed sequences across vertebrates, while their passenger strands always showed various divergence patterns. The divergence mainly resulted from divergence of different animal species, homologous miRNA genes and multicopy miRNA hairpin precursors. Some miRNA* sequences were phylogenetically conserved in seed and anchor sequences similar to mature miRNAs, while others revealed high levels of nucleotide divergence despite some of their partners were highly conserved. Most of those miRNA precursors that could generate abundant miRNAs from both strands always were well conserved in sequences of miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p, especially for their seed sequences. Conclusions The final fate of miRNA* strand, either degraded as merely carrier strand or expressed abundantly as potential functional guide miRNA, may be destined across evolution. Well-conserved miRNA* strands, particularly conservation in seed sequences, maybe afford potential opportunities for contributing to regulation network. The study will broaden our understanding of potential functional miRNA* species. © 2010 Guo et al.',\n",

Basing on the complex variable partial differential method, an accurate algorithm was developed for parameter sensitivity analyzing during model updating. An iterative pattern was established for model updating with static measured data. With considering modal character forces, modal dynamic finite element model was equivalent to a static model for updating. Formulations of error estimates are derived for the model updating algorithm stability analysis. The numerical examples show that the developed method could efficiently update multiple and/or nonlinear parameters. The finite element model of Runyang suspension bridge tower was updated with the proposed method. The identified parameters are more accurate, and the correlation between the updated model and actual structure is much higher.',\n",

       " 'zEurWWVC': {'abstract': 'This paper proposes a method of realizing generalized chaos synchronization of a weighted complex network with different nodes. Chaotic systems with diverse structures are taken as the nodes of the complex dynamical network, the nonlinear terms of the systems are taken as coupling functions, and the relations among the nodes are built through weighted connections. The structure of the coupling functions between the connected nodes is obtained based on Lyapunov stability theory. A complex network with nodes of Lorenz system, Coullet system, Rössler system and the New system is taken as an example for simulation study and the results show that generalized chaos synchronization exists in the whole weighted complex network with different nodes when the coupling strength among the nodes is given with any weight value. The method can be used in realizing generalized chaos synchronization of a weighted complex network with different nodes. Furthermore, both the weight value of the coupling strength among the nodes and the number of the nodes have no effect on the stability of synchronization in the whole complex network. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n",

       " '5CDB0eUZ': {'abstract': 'Gene expression data from microarrays are being applied to predict preclinical and clinical endpoints, but the reliability of these predictions has not been established. In the MAQC-II project, 36 independent teams analyzed six microarray data sets to generate predictive models for classifying a sample with respect to one of 13 endpoints indicative of lung or liver toxicity in rodents, or of breast cancer, multiple myeloma or neuroblastoma in humans. In total, >30,000 models were built using many combinations of analytical methods. The teams generated predictive models without knowing the biological meaning of some of the endpoints and, to mimic clinical reality, tested the models on data that had not been used for training. We found that model performance depended largely on the endpoint and team proficiency and that different approaches generated models of similar performance. The conclusions and recommendations from MAQC-II should be useful for regulatory agencies, study committees and independent investigators that evaluate methods for global gene expression analysis. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

During the past two decades, a great deal of efforts has been devoted to the structure of C-S-H at the nanoscale level, including both experiment investigation and molecular simulation. The smallest C-S-H unit has a layered crystal structure at atomic scale, with a lamella thickness in the nm range. And moreover, ordered stacks of up to several tens or even hundreds of nano-lamellae have been observed experimentally. The key features of structure and morphology is remarkably the ubiquitous presence of an orientational order. Now we focus on the physical understanding on such orientational ordered C-S-H structures at mesoscale. In respect that there exists a high nematic order in the stacking C-S-H of nano-lamellae, by introducing some physical parameters, such as the magnitude of nematic order of the nano-lamellae, we try to predict the mechanical properties of the crystalline in terms of its micro-structure. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.',\n",

A radial integration method coupling with radial basis function approximation technology was used to convert domain integral into equivalent boundary integral. With central finite difference method, an explicit time iteration scheme was established for solving transient diffusion equation. Two numerical examples for 2D diffusion problem were given to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

In the study, we developed an approach for comparing relative expression levels of different miRNAs based on suitable endogenous miRNA control and their locus in the genome, miRNA group (such as miRNA cluster and miRNA 5amily), and phylogenetic relationship between corresponding precursor sequences. According to the approach, we analyzed miR-17-92 cluster and miR-17 family in mouse NIH3T3 cells from high throughput sequencing data using SOLID™ system. Expression analysis of miR-17-92 cluster and miR-17 (mir-17) family showed evident diversity although some miRNAs were transcribed as a single polycistronic transcript. Combining locus on chromosome and phylogenetic relationship between precursors, different expression levels of these miRNAs might imply complex regulatory networks with gene locus and provide evolutionary and functional implication in miRNA biogenesis, especially for comparing miRNA expression profiles under varying conditions or between mutants and wild type. Our studies show that expression comparison of miRNAs correlated with locus, miRNA group, and phylogenetic relationship, can reveal important insights into the biogenesis, evolution, and function of miRNAs. © 2010 IEEE.',\n",

The difference in color of selvage has something to do with the temperature and humidity of cloth, dye hydrolysis, bad dye compatibility and the irregularity of the both ends of the cloth. The causes of stain-defects lie in these four following aspects: alkali-saline patches, water droplets on the cloth, packing film dressing lax and condensate infiltrates rolls. Inadequate pre-treatment and using sodium in the process of dyeing can lead to feel hard. Poor color fastness is related to soap making, seam mark has something to do with winding tension, fabric variety and seam.

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed. We use real-world traffic and all L7-filter protocol patterns to make our experiments, and the results show that the system achieves at Gbps level throughout in 4-cores Servers. © 2010 IEEE.',\n",

But recently, this technique is also adopted by cyber-criminals and Internet miscreants to evade identification and to frustrate law enforcement and anticrime efforts aimed at locating and shutting down the illegal service. Previous work on this topic focuses mostly on detecting and measuring existing fast-flux based service networks ignoring the most import property provided by them-high availability under countermeasures. This paper attacks the availability problem of fast-flux based service network under countermeasures. In this paper, counter-system is taken into account and a model of these networks under countermeasures is presented. Based on this model, two evaluating factors of availability are proposed. By using reliability theory and queuing theory, this paper also performs a study of typical fast-flux based networks and their availability.

We focus on the problem of ordering the filtering units adaptively to minimize the cost in a multimedia stream environment where filtering units are very expensive. Significant performance gains are achieved by sharing filtering units across filtering rules. Existing methods are based on a greedy method which orders the filtering units according to three factors of the filtering units, i,e., the selectivity, connectivity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn't been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set by prior-knowledge which cannot adjust to the multimedia stream where characteristics of stream and filtering units vary unpredictably over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchal clustering ordering framework (HCOF), which executes a two-stage ordering strategy. In the first ordering stage, HCOF clusters all the filtering units according to their popularities and costs factors. In the second stage, for each cluster, all the filtering units are then ordered according to their selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real multimedia streams demonstrate that our HCOF method outperforms other existing filtering methods. © 2010 IEEE.\",\n",

To study the mechanism of archaeal sliding clamps, we sought to generate knockouts for each pcna gene in Sulfolobus islandicus, a hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon, but failed with two conventional knockout methods. Then, a new knockout scheme, known as marker insertion and target gene deletion (MID), was developed, with which transformants were obtained for each pMID-pcna plasmid. We found that mutant cells persisted in transformant cultures during incubation of pMID-pcna3 and pMID-araS-pcna1 transformants under counter selection. Studying the propagation of mutant cells by semiquantitative PCR analysis of the deleted target gene allele (Dpcna1 or Dpcna3) revealed that mutant cells could no longer be propagated, demonstrating that these pcna genes are absolutely required for host cell viability. Because the only prerequisite for this assay is the generation of a MID transformant, this approach can be applied generally to any micro-organisms proficient in homologous recombination. © 2010 SGM.',\n",

Existing research on learning from related data streams is based on an assumption that all streams arrive at a central processing unit in a synchronous way, such that in an arbitrary sliding window, all tuples of the streams can be perfectly joined together. This assumption, however, does not hold when related data streams are generated or transferred at different speeds, and thus may arrive in the central processing unit in an asynchronous manner. In this paper, we argue that for asynchronous data streams, there exist a small portion of perfectly joined examples (i.e., complete examples) and a large portion of partially joined examples (i.e., incomplete examples). Accordingly, we present a new Learning from Complete and Fixed Examples (LCFE) framework that can fix incomplete examples to boost the learning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that LCFE is able to achieve a higher prediction accuracy for learning from related data streams than other simple solutions can offer. © 2010 IEEE.',\n",

Multiple local monitors which collect low-level statistics (velocity or direction) are placed over the image. With the monitors' observation and a set of reference measurement previously acquired, a pixel-wise surprise trigger is computed using Bayesian probabilistic inference techniques. Once the surprise value exceed by a preset threshold, the monitor outputs an alert. These alerts are integrated to a final decision regarding the existence of an unusual event.

First, due to large and continuous data volumes, we are unable to maintain all stream records to form a candidate pool for missing value estimation, as most existing methods commonly do. Second, even if we could maintain all complete stream records using a summary structure, the concept drifting problem would make some information obsolete, and thus deteriorate the imputation accuracy. Third, in data streams, it is necessary to develop a fast yet accurate algorithm to find most similar data for imputation. Fourth, due to dynamic and sophisticated data collection environments, the missing rate of most stream data may be much higher than that in databases, so the imputation method should be able to handle high missing rate in the data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Streaming k-Nearest-Neighbors Imputation Framework (SKIF) for concept drifting data streams. To handle concept drifting and large volume problems in data streams, SKIF first summarizes historical complete records in some micro-resources (which are high-level statistical data structures), and maintains these micro-resources in a candidate pool as benchmark data. After that, SKIF employs a novel hybrid-kNN imputation procedure, which uses a hybrid similarity search mechanism, to find the most similar micro-resources from the large scale candidate pool efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SKIF framework for data stream imputation tasks. © 2010 ACM.',\n",

Most image classification systems have taken one of two approaches, using either global or local features exclusively. This may be in part due to the difficulty of combining a single global feature vector with a set of local features in a suitable manner. To classify images for versatile applications, an effective algorithm is needed urgently. In this paper, we propose a new texture invariant descriptor to represent global features of an image, and propose a new method which combining local appearance feature with this texture descriptor in face image classification application.

       " 'A1r2yKn1': {'abstract': \"Ensemble learning is a commonly used tool for building prediction models from data streams, due to its intrinsic merits of handling large volumes stream data. Despite of its extraordinary successes in stream data mining, existing ensemble models, in stream data environments, mainly fall into the ensemble classifiers category, without realizing that building classifiers requires labor intensive labeling process, and it is often the case that we may have a small number of labeled samples to train a few classifiers, but a large number of unlabeled samples are available to build clusters from data streams. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new ensemble model which combines both classifiers and clusters together for mining data streams. We argue that the main challenges of this new ensemble model include (1) clusters formulated from data streams only carry cluster IDs, with no genuine class label information, and (2) concept drifting underlying data streams makes it even harder to combine clusters and classifiers into one ensemble framework. To handle challenge (1), we present a label propagation method to infer each cluster's class label by making full use of both class label information from classifiers, and internal structure information from clusters. To handle challenge (2), we present a new weighting schema to weight all base models according to their consistencies with the up-to-date base model. As a result, all classifiers and clusters can be combined together, through a weighted average mechanism, for prediction. Experiments on real-world data streams demonstrate that our method outperforms simple classifier ensemble and cluster ensemble for stream data mining. © 2010 IEEE.\",\n",

In this paper, we argue that DoS attack can be taken as continuous data streams, and thus can be detected by using stream data mining methods. More specifically, we propose a new Weighted Ensemble learning model to detect the DoS attacks. The Weighted Ensemble model first trains base classifiers using different data classification algorithms (i.e., decision tree, SVMs, and Naive Bayes) on multiple successive data chunks, and then weights each base classifier according to its prediction accuracy on the up-to-date data. Experimental results on the benchmark KDDCUP'99 dataset demonstrate that our new Weighted Ensemble model is able to successfully detect DoS attacks. © 2010 IEEE.\",\n",

Our essential goal is to build a robust prediction model from noisy stream data to accurately predict future samples. For noisy data sources, most existing works rely on data preprocessing techniques to cleanse noisy samples before the training of decision models. In data stream environments, these data preprocessing techniques are, unfortunately, hard to apply, mainly because the concept drifting in a data stream may make it very difficult to differentiate noise from samples of changing concepts. Accordingly, we propose an aggregate ensemble (AE) learning framework. The aim of AE is to build a robust ensemble model that can tolerate data errors. Theoretical and empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that the proposed AE learning framework is capable of building accurate classification models from noisy data streams. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are few published papers in literatures for various reasons. In this paper, based on the engineering technical requirements and the corresponding cutter head's structure design requirements, a nonlinear multi-objective disc cutters' layout mathematical model with complex constraints and the corresponding multi-stage solution strategy are presented, in which the whole disc cutters' layout design process is decomposed into the disc cutters' spacing design and the disc cutters' plane layout design. A numerical simulation method based on the FEM theory is adopted to simulate the rock chipping process induced by three TBM disc cutters to determine the optimal cutter spacing. And a cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA) is adopted to solve the disc cutters' plane layout design problem. Finally, a disc cutters' layout design instance of the TBM is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The computational results show that the proposed method can be used to solve the disc cutters' layout design problem of the TBM and provide various layout schemes within short running times for the engineers to choose from. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\",\n",

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is usually adopted to cater to the need for real-time processing of network traffic. However, the huge memory usage of DFA prevents it from being applied even on a medium-sized pattern set. In this article, we propose a matrix decomposition method for DFA table compression. The basic idea of the method is to decompose a DFA table into the sum of a row vector, a column vector and a sparse matrix, all of which cost very little space.

Its conclusions are very important in set theory, logic, analysis, algebra and so on.

The objective of this paper is to solve the Ramsey number problem. We propose an improved DNA computing model based on the biological operations in the Adleman-Lipton model, the solution space of stickers in the sticker-based model, and the add-bit-sequence coding method proposed by Xu Jin, et al. According to the proposed algorithm, we can obtain lower bound and upper bound by means of specific mathematical formulas which already exist firstly. For each number from lower bound to upper bound, we build the initial answer space. Then, we remove the DNA chains which accord with special qualifications. Finally, we detect the final test tube to confirm whether the current number is a Ramsey number or not. The theoretic analysis and simulated experiments show that the solution to the difficult Ramsey number problem is possible in acceptable time, provided that the technology of DNA biology is mature enough in the future.\",\n",

Strain REY15A is a host for a versatile genetic toolbox. It exhibits a genome of minimal size, is stable genetically, and is easy to grow and manipulate. Strain HVE10/4 shows a broad host range for exceptional crenarchaeal viruses and conjugative plasmids and was selected for studying their life cycles and host interactions. The genomes of strains REY15A and HVE10/4 are 2.5 and 2.7 Mb, respectively, and each genome carries a variable region of 0.5 to 0.7 Mb where major differences in gene content and gene order occur. These include gene clusters involved in specific metabolic pathways, multiple copies of VapBC antitoxin-toxin gene pairs, and in strain HVE10/4, a 50-kb region rich in glycosyl transferase genes. The variable region also contains most of the insertion sequence (IS) elements and high proportions of the orphan orfB elements and SMN1 miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), as well as the clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based immune systems, which are complex and diverse in both strains, consistent with them having been mobilized both intra- and intercellularly. In contrast, the remainder of the genomes are highly conserved in their protein and RNA gene syntenies, closely resembling those of other S. islandicus and Sulfolobus solfataricus strains, and they exhibit only minor remnants of a few genetic elements, mainly conjugative plasmids, which have integrated at a few tRNA genes lacking introns.

Systematic analysis of SOLiD sequencing dataset showed that 37.94% short RNAs could simultaneously map to more than one miRNA precursor, and more short RNAs were found to have multiple genomic loci. Improper selection from candidate loci might lose some mapping information, influence miRNA expression profile or even mislead to identify novel miRNAs. A comprehensive study indicated several potential features for correction strategy: location and distribution of mismatches, quality values, expression profiles of multiple isomiRs (miRNA variants), miRNA* and moRs (miRNA-offset-RNAs) at candidate locus and in its flank sequence.

Application traffic classification based on regular expressions is an essential step for deep packet inspection. However regular expression, especially multiple regular expression matching is known to require intensive system resources and is often a performance bottleneck. Currently, the DFAs of regular expression are constructed in the preprocessing stage and the context of network streams is excluded which leads to low throughputs. In this paper, we analyzed the application level protocols and found that the protocols are asymmetrically distributed and it is changing dynamically. From the protocol distribution characteristic, we proposed an adaptive multiple regular expression matching method for application traffic classification with deep packet inspection. The adaptive method, schedule the multiple DFAs through splay tree by matching probability other than linear scheduling in linked list, can adjust scheduling sequence according with the changing dynamic traffics. We evaluate the proposed method with the L7 rules; experiments proved that our method can improve the throughputs more than three times. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.',\n",

       " 'LaHar5Mp': {'abstract': 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles in various biological processes. miRNA cross-mapping is a prevalent phenomenon where miRNA sequence originating from one genomic region is mapped to another location. To have a better understanding of this phenomenon in the human genome, we performed a detailed analysis in this paper using public miRNA high-throughput sequencing data and all known human miRNAs. We observed widespread cross-mapping events between miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs), other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and the opposite strands of pre-miRNAs by analyzing the high-throughput sequencing data. Computational analysis on all known human miRNAs also confirmed that many of them could be involved in cross-mapping events. The processing or decay of both ncRNAs and pre-miRNA opposite strand transcripts may contribute to miRNA enrichment, although some might be miRNA-mimics due to miRNA mis-annotation. Comparing to canonical miRNAs, miRNAs involved in cross-mapping events between pre-miRNAs and other ncRNAs normally had shorter lengths (17-19 nt), lower prediction scores and were classified as pseudo miRNA precursors. Notably, 4.9% of all human miRNAs could be accurately mapped to the opposite strands of pre-miRNAs, which showed that both strands of the same genomic region had the potential to produce mature miRNAs and simultaneously implied some potential miRNA precursors. We proposed that the cross-mapping events are more complex than we previously thought. Sequence similarity between other ncRNAs and pre-miRNAs and the specific stem-loop structures of pre-miRNAs may provide evolutionary implications. © 2011 Guo et al.',\n",

The knowledge of protocol specifications is also an effective way of detecting malicious code. However, current methods for obtaining unknown protocol specifications highly rely on manual operations, such as reverse engineering which is a major instrument for extracting application-level specifications but is time-consuming and laborious. Several works have focus their attentions on extracting protocol messages from real-world trace automatically, and leave protocol state machine unsolved. In this paper, we propose Veritas, a system that can automatically infer protocol state machine from real-world network traces. The main feature of Veritas is that it has no prior knowledge of protocol specifications, and our technique is based on the statistical analysis on the protocol formats. We also formally define a new model - probabilistic protocol state machine (P-PSM), which is a probabilistic generalization of protocol state machine. In our experiments, we evaluate a text-based protocol and two binary-based protocols to test the performance of Veritas. Our results show that the protocol state machines that Veritas infers can accurately represent 92% of the protocol flows on average. Our system is general and suitable for both text-based and binary-based protocols. Veritas can also be employed as an auxiliary tool for analyzing unknown behaviors in real-world applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.',\n",

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to observe and utilize them in traffic classification. In this paper, we analysis the expected matching times per flow before it is classified. Then, we introduce an enhanced traffic classification engine with the help of above characteristics and some optimizations, which has the same matching accuracy with the original L7-filter engine.

Principal Findings: Over 30% isomiRs were detected with 3′ non-template additional nucleotides, especially for additional nucleotide of adenosine. However, these modified isomiRs showed a lower percentage of total miRNA expression (<15%). Generally, 1-3 abundant isomiRs from a given miRNA locus were identified, but none of them was detected with 3′ additions. Different miRNAs indicated various isomiR spectrums and expression patterns. The most abundant isomiR spectrum, isomiR profile and expression pattern always were stability, but herein we found several exceptions across samples, especially between normal and diseased samples. At isomiR level, we detected a distinct subset of differentially expressed modified isomiRs between normal and diseased samples or between mild and severe samples. Gene Ontology analysis of their experimentally validated target genes revealed enrichment for specific biological process categories. Conclusions: The phenomenon of multiple isomiRs, especially for isomiRs with 3′ additions, is not a random event during pre-miRNA processing. Varieties of isomiRs and expression patterns reveal potential functional implication and should be taken into account. The study enriches association of miRNAs and human disease, including potential roles of various miRNA variants and 3′ addition events. © 2011 Guo et al.',\n",

In order to interrogate the in vivo role of archaeal topo III, we constructed and characterized a topo III gene deletion mutant of Sulfolobus islandicus.

Flow cytometry analysis revealed changes of the mutant in growth cycle characteristics including an increase in proportion of cells containing either more than two genome equivalents or less than one genome equivalent in exponentially-growing cultures. As shown by fluorescence microscopy, a fraction of mutant cells in the cultures were drastically enlarged, and at least some of the enlarged cells were apparently capable of resuming cell division. The mutant also shows a different transcriptional profile from that of the wild-type strain.

Recognizing large numbers of strings with U-, V-, and U-V-uncertain-strings, including the interleaving of two or more uncertain strings, is important to thoroughly gathering useful information and detecting harmful information. This paper proposes a complete automaton and its high-speed construction algorithm for large-scale U-, V-, and U-V-uncertain multiple strings, including two or more uncertain strings interlaced with one another. The maximum number of parallel complete automation of the V-uncertain string is also given. This paper reveals that there are two kinds of pretermissions, i. e., similarly-connected and interlaced-string pretermissions, and that mistake may appear in the matching of the regular expressions, or states in the automaton may increase in number, if the intersection of the U-uncertain strings sets and the homologous subsequent special point in the U-uncertain strings sets are not eliminated from the whole system. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.',\n",

DFA engine is usually used as a classical representation for regular expressions to perform pattern matching, because it only need O(1) time to process one input character. However, DFAs of regular expression sets require large amount of memory, which limits the practical application of regular expressions in high-speed networks. Some compression algorithms have been proposed to address this issue in recent literatures. In this paper, we reconsider this problem from a new perspective, namely observing the characteristic of transition distribution inside each state, which is different from previous algorithms that observe transition characteristic among states. Furthermore, we introduce a new compression algorithm which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA stably without significant impact on matching speed. Moreover, our work is orthogonal to previous compression algorithms, such as D2FA, δFA. Our experiment results show that applying our work to them will have several times memory reduction, and matching speed of up to dozens of times comparing with original δFA in software implementation. © 2011 IEEE.',\n",

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte.

To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction.

       " 'wHg28Xap': {'abstract': 'Ensemble learning has become a common tool for data stream classification, being able to handle large volumes of stream data and concept drifting. Previous studies focus on building accurate prediction models from stream data. However, a linear scan of a large number of base classifiers in the ensemble during prediction incurs significant costs in response time, preventing ensemble learning from being practical for many real world time-critical data stream applications, such as Web traffic stream monitoring, spam detection, and intrusion detection. In these applications, data streams usually arrive at a speed of GB/second, and it is necessary to classify each stream record in a timely manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel Ensemble-tree (E-tree for short) indexing structure to organize all base classifiers in an ensemble for fast prediction. On one hand, E-trees treat ensembles as spatial databases and employ an R-tree like height-balanced structure to reduce the expected prediction time from linear to sub-linear complexity. On the other hand, E-trees can automatically update themselves by continuously integrating new classifiers and discarding outdated ones, well adapting to new trends and patterns underneath data streams. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach. Copyright 2011 ACM.',\n",

Prior works on traffic classification mainly focus their attentions on dividing Internet traffic into different categories based on application layer protocols (such as HTTP, BitTorrent etc.). Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base64-encoded image, Base64-encoded text and Encrypted). The chief features of our classifier are small computing space (about 1K Bytes) and high classification accuracy (about 81%). © 2011 IEEE.',\n",

We investigated that whether the key serum miRNAs could discriminate patients with and without breast cancer. This study was divided into three parts: (1) miRNA marker discovery using SOLiD sequencing-based miRNA profiling on cancerous and adjacent noncancerous breast tissue of one breast cancer patient; (2) marker selection and validation by real-time PCR on a small set of serum; (3) gene ontology analysis of the key miRNA target genes. Of genome-wide tissue miRNA expression analysis, five miRNAs were found to be altered more than fivefold by SOLiD sequencing (i.e., miR-29a, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-192, and miR-21). All the five miRNAs were validated on the 20 breast cancer patients and 20 controls. miR-29a and miR-21 were significantly increased in the serum of breast cancer patients (P<.05). Gene ontology analysis of the target genes revealed enrichment for special biological process categories, that is, signal transduction, development, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell adhesion. SOLiD sequencing provides a promising method for cancer-related miRNA profiling. Serum miRNAs may be useful biomarkers for breast cancer detection. Copyright © 2011 Qian Wu et al.',\n",

But it is also required to operate separately from the grid in planned or unplanned island mode due to different reasons, e.g., power outage, abnormal weather. Then, a multi-objective optimization method to size MG based on different operational scenarios study is proposed. The objectives consist of MG construction and operation cost, reliability cost, ancillary values, utilization of renewable energy and emission. An improved customer outage cost analysis method is demonstrated taking power outage reasons and reliability requirement of load into consideration.

Different grinding conditions were performed for evaluation of RMS of acoustic emission(AE) signals and understanding the effect of each grinding parameter on AE RMS during grinding process. A kind of on-line monitoring method based on wavelet analysis and acoustic emission was raised and the nonlinear relation model between AE RMS,wavelet energy coefficients and wheel passivation state was built. During the process,the wavelet analysis method was used to decompose the original signals for extracting wavelet energy coefficients. The results of experiments indicates that AE RMS increases with increasing table speed;The corresponding relation between AE RMS and table speed is good and could take the table speed as the main parameter for studying wheel passivation state. As a result, the nonlinear relation model can monitor the wheel passivation degree on-line accurately through training. This provides a kind of viable method which has very high practical value for confirming the wheel dressing cycle. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications.',\n",

       " '5s5hp9VN': {'abstract': 'Background: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are a critical component for many underlying biological processes. A PPI network can provide insight into the mechanisms of these processes, as well as the relationships among different proteins and toxicants that are potentially involved in the processes. There are many PPI databases publicly available, each with a specific focus. The challenge is how to effectively combine their contents to generate a robust and biologically relevant PPI network.Methods: In this study, seven public PPI databases, BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, REACTOME, and SPIKE, were used to explore a powerful approach to combine multiple PPI databases for an integrated PPI network. We developed a novel method called k-votes to create seven different integrated networks by using values of k ranging from 1-7. Functional modules were mined by using SCAN, a Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks. Overall module qualities were evaluated for each integrated network using the following statistical and biological measures: (1) modularity, (2) similarity-based modularity, (3) clustering score, and (4) enrichment.Results: Each integrated human PPI network was constructed based on the number of votes (k) for a particular interaction from the committee of the original seven PPI databases. The performance of functional modules obtained by SCAN from each integrated network was evaluated. The optimal value for k was determined by the functional module analysis. Our results demonstrate that the k-votes method outperforms the traditional union approach in terms of both statistical significance and biological meaning. The best network is achieved at k=2, which is composed of interactions that are confirmed in at least two PPI databases. In contrast, the traditional union approach yields an integrated network that consists of all interactions of seven PPI databases, which might be subject to high false positives.Conclusions: We determined that the k-votes method for constructing a robust PPI network by integrating multiple public databases outperforms previously reported approaches and that a value of k=2 provides the best results. The developed strategies for combining databases show promise in the advancement of network construction and modeling. © 2011 Swamy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.',\n",

       " 'XcBDxyJy': {'abstract': 'With the dramatic development of computational science and technology, computer simulation is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and engineering practice, and is believed to bring about a profound revolution to the mode and means of these activities. For chemical engineering, it will promote the transition from an experience-and-experiment-based research and development mode to the one based on virtual process engineering (VPE). However, such a revolution still requires tremendous improvements in the Accuracy of physical modeling and numerical methods, the Capability of the computing hardware and software, and the Efficiency of the simulation activities, or in short, ACE. This article will systematically review the 3-decade endeavors at IPE, CAS (Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences) on upgrading ACE by establishing a multi-scale computing paradigm focusing on meso-scale structures. We also report recent developments in this direction with projections on future work. Meso-scales refer to the intermediate scales at which the discrete elements in a system interact to shape the global behavior of the system. Reasonable description of the structures at such scales is a bottleneck for reliable and accurate modeling of global behaviors. To address this problem, we started from gas-solid flow by proposing the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model to quantify the hydrodynamics of meso-scale structures in gas-solid fluidization. This model, that is, its stability condition, was thoroughly analyzed and verified with the pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) method. Other systems, such as turbulence and gas-liquid flow, were then studied following the same strategy, revealing the ubiquity of stability conditions for meso-scale structures as a result of the compromise among different dominant mechanisms, and leading to a generalized model mathematically formulated as a multi-objective variational (MOV) problem. Meanwhile, along with wider industrial applications of the EMMS-based simulation methods, common features were recognized that ACE requires structural consistency among the simulated system, the physical model, the numerical software and the computing hardware under the umbrella of MOV, which we have named as the EMMS Paradigm. The EMMS Paradigm was first implemented from the software level using traditional computing hardware to achieve Accuracy. Since 2007, with the development of general-purpose GPU (graphic processing unit) computing, CPU (central processing unit)-GPU hybrid computing was deployed to implement the Paradigm from the hardware level, boosting the Capability to Petaflops range. In applying the Paradigm to the development of an industrial petro-chemical process (maximizing iso-paraffins, MIP), enabling technologies such as pre- and post-processing, error-tolerance, network-based computing and seamless integration of different simulation methods are now under development, which will greatly improve the Efficiency. A demonstration virtual laboratory featuring the comparison and interaction of online measurement and real-time computing is under construction. With these endeavors, an industrial process could be simulated globally in almost real-time, and different levels of details could be traced from the global distribution of flow parameters in a reactor to the inner-channels of catalytic particles at a perceivable evolution speed. The realization of VPE is, therefore, in the foreseeable future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

Results show that it is preferable to suppress the dispersion of positioning data points by applying constraint of geocentric distance of spacecraft when there is only VLBI tracking data. The positioning solution with observations of three VLBI stations is a biased estimate. For the case of four tracking stations the uncertainty of the constraint should be in accordance with the orbit prediction error. If the uncertainty is too large then the effect of suppression on the dispersion of positioning points would be limited. If it is too small then some systematic offset would be led into the positioning results. White noises in delay and ranging mainly result in dispersion of positioning data points. While systematic errors in observations result in systematic offsets in the positioning results, and there are trend asymptotic line jumps in the sequence of positioning points, which could also be taken as a criterion for the existence of systematic errors in observations. In addition, at the moment when VLBI stations change from three to four or vice versa, there may exist the trend jump in the sequence of positioning points. The analysis in this paper could provide a reference for the positioning reduction of spacecraft in the follow-on lunar exploration and the Yinghuo project.',\n",

Yet its high memory consumption and low prediction efficiency have made it less favorable for stream oriented applications. Specifically, traditional lazy learning stores all the training data and the inductive process is deferred until a query appears, whereas in stream applications, data records flow continuously in large volumes and the prediction of class labels needs to be made in a timely manner. In this paper, we provide a systematic solution that overcomes the memory and efficiency limitations and enables fast lazy learning for concept drifting data streams. In particular, we propose a novel Lazy-tree (Ltree for short) indexing structure that dynamically maintains compact high-level summaries of historical stream records. L-trees are M-Tree [5] like, height-balanced, and can help achieve great memory consumption reduction and sub-linear time complexity for prediction. Moreover, L-trees continuously absorb new stream records and discard outdated ones, so they can naturally adapt to the dynamically changing concepts in data streams for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach. © 2011 IEEE.',\n",

However, previous mining algorithms were all focused on a single data stream. In many emerging applications, it is of critical importance to combine multiple data streams for analysis. For example, in real-time news topic analysis, it is necessary to combine multiple news report streams from dierent media sources to discover collaborative frequent patterns which are reported frequently in all media, and comparative frequent patterns which are reported more frequently in a media than others. To address this problem, we propose a novel frequent pattern mining algorithm Hybrid-Streaming, H-Stream for short.

Existing research efforts on Cloud computing were all focused on designing advanced storage and query techniques for static data. None of them consider the problem that data in a Cloud may appear as continuous and rapid data streams. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a new LCN-Index framework to handle continuous data stream queries in the Cloud. LCN-Index uses the Map-Reduce computing paradigm to process all the queries. In the Mapping stage, it divides all the queries into a batch of predicate sets which are then deployed onto mapping nodes using interval predicate index. In the reducing stage, it merges results from the mapping nodes using multi attribute hash index. In so doing, a data stream can be efficiently evaluated by traversing through the LCN-Index framework. Experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. © 2011 ACM.',\n",

When the training data can not be separated by linear classifiers, KSVM is a crucial technique to overcome this shortage in a supervised-learning framework. In a semi-supervised learning framework, LapSVM, is the state-of-the-art technique which better handles both generalization of the classifier and out-of-sample problem.

The DCs were purified by murine CD11c microbeads. The morphologies of DCs were observed by electron microscopy (EM). Such surface markers as MHC-II, CD80 and CD86 were tested by flow cytometry (FCM). The proliferation capacity of allogeneic T cells stimulated by DCs was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The expressions of cell factors in mRNA of DCs were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). The cytokines in supernatant were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).

In imDCs, the relative mRNA expressions of IL12p35 (0.66 ± 0.13), IL12p40 (0.57 ± 0.10) and IFN-γ (0.74 ± 0.08) were lower than those of mDCs (1.00 ± 0.00), (P < 0.05), but the expression of TGF-β (1.35 ± 0.09) was higher than that of mDCs by QPCR (1.00 ± 0.00), (P < 0.05). The expressions of IL12p70 and IFN-γ in supernatants from imDCs were lower than those of mDCs[IL12p70: (6 ± 4) vs (120 ± 22); IFN-γ: (56 ± 15) vs (90 ± 15), P < 0.05] while the expression of TGF (transforming growth factor)-0 was higher than that of mDCs by ELISA [TGF-β: (176 ± 23) vs (55 ± 18), P < 0.05]. Conclusion: ImDCs can induce anergic T cells and immune tolerance through a down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC-II and Th1 cytokines and an up-regulation of Th2 cytokine (TGF-β). And MDCs may activate naive T cells and stimulate immune responses by an up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC-II and Thl cytokines.

Spacing design of adjacent cutters not only is related to the boundary conditions and rock as well as the cutter and cutter parameters of the tunneling parameters, but also couples with the cutter structure interaction; it is a sequential process of broken rock. Based on the finite element simulation platform of rock crushing-Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA2D), considering the adjacent multi-cutters sequential constraints, taking two typical rocks (muddy pink sandstone and granite gneiss) as boundary conditions, smoother hob times under the vertical pressure into the rock crushing simulation model were constructed. This simulated how the multi-cutters in the sequential and simultaneous pressure pushed the rock into the simulation process. The mapping between disc cutters spacing and rock fragmentation energy was established, and thereby a mapping between multi-cutters sequential location angle and the energy of rock fragmentation was established during spacing of the optimal cutters. The cutters' optimal spacing and the optimal sequential angle in a different location can be determined through this mapping, and it can also provide the design basis for the layout design of future cutters.\",\n",

A feasible numerical method is required to predict chloride penetration in concrete structures. A transient meshless boundary element method is proposed to predict chloride diffusion in concrete with time dependent nonlinear coefficient. Taking Greens function as the weighted function, the weighted residue method is adopted to transform the diffusion equation into equivalent integral equations. By the coupling of radial integral method and radial basis function approximation, the domain integrals in equivalent control equations are transformed into boundary integrals. Following the general procedure of boundary element meshing and traditional finite difference method, a set of nonlinear algebraic equations are constructed and are eventually solved with the modified Newtonian iterative method. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed model. A comparison of the simulated chloride concentration with the corresponding reported experimental data in a real marine structure indicates the high accuracy and advantage of the time dependent coefficient and nonlinear model over the conventional constant coefficient model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we developed a method to analyze relative expression levels of special RNA classes according to divergence of 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Generally, there were several quite abundant RNA classes from a given miRNA locus, which suggested dominant cleavage sites ofDrosha and Dicer during pre-miRNA processing. Compared with 3′ end, dominant cleavage site in 5' end always focused on a specific position, which ensured conservation of the identity of miR-NA (5'-seed sequence, nucleotides 2-8).

Circulating miRNAs are considered as potentially useful non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of pregnancy-related disease and congenital disorders, but maternal peripheral blood miRNAs expression profile in pregnancy remains less investigated. We thus set out to investigate maternal plasma miRNAs expression profile using genome-wide sequencing. Methods: Maternal plasma miRNA expression profiles of different pregnancy stages were detected by SOLiD sequencing. We observed the expression level of the most abundant miRNAs in maternal plasma during pregnancy process. We examined functional relationships of targets of pregnancy-relative miRNAs by enrichment analyzing of signaling pathways. Results: 147 miRNAs were sequenced from maternal plasma in this study, among them, 90 types of miRNAs were found in all of the samples, while 136 miRNAs in the first trimester gestation, 108 in second trimester gestation, and 99 miRNAs in the third trimester gestation, respectively. The varieties and the expression level of maternal plasma miRNAs were changing during pregnancy. The expression level of miRNA cluster members was changing with the same trend during pregnancy. The function and functional relationship analysis of target genes of pregnancy-relative miRNAs showed that genetic disorder, immunological disease, cell signaling, cancer, and cell cycle were the enriched pathways. Conclusions: Maternal plasma miRNA expression profiles are dynamically changing during pregnancy. The results of function analysis suggested that miRNAs may play an important role in regulating pregnancy process, which can help us understand the refine regulation mechanism in pregnancy. Moreover, the results of this present study may be the basis for a further study to find useful prenatal diagnosis biomarkers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Despite the presence of a plethora of non-coding RNAs longer than 50-nucleotide (nt) in length in various species of Archaea, little is known about smRNAs in archaea that resemble the 20-24-nt long smRNAs found in eukaryotes, which have been implicated in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Here, we report the finding of a large number of smRNAs approximatelly 20-nt in length, including phased smRNAs and potential miRNAs, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus p2 (Ssp2) based on deep sequencing. The expression of some of the miRNA candidates in Ssp2 was confirmed. Consistent with the Ssp2 hyperthermophilic properties, we found that higher temperatures more efficiently induced the production of the miRNA candidates in an in vitro system using the putative foldback precursor transcripts incubated with Ssp2 extract. Although we initially predicted putative target genes of some miRNA candidates, further analysis mapped the cleavage sites downstream of the miRNA candidate complementary regions, similar to those involved in plant miRNA-mediated TAS transcript cleavage. We also identified smRNAs from clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci, which play important roles in prokaryotic microbial defense systems. Archaea represent a unique life form next to Bacteria and Eukarya, and our results may provide a useful resource for further in-depth study on the regulation and evolution of smRNAs in this special organism. © 2012 Xu et al.',\n",

Under well-founded semantics, all the algorithms are sound and completed, and their computational complexities are polynomial. In this framework, security policy declaration, evaluation and verification are executed under the same semantics, which is significant for security policy management.

Remarkably, the enzyme is able to synthesize products far longer than templates in vitro. Here we show that the long products resulted from template-dependent polymerization across discontinuous templates (PADT) by SsoPriSL. PADT was initiated through either primer synthesis or terminal transfer, and occurred efficiently on templates containing contiguous dCs. Template switching took place when the 3′-end of a growing strand synthesized on one template annealed to another template directly or following the terminal addition of nucleotides, and was subsequently extended on the new template. The key to PADT was the ability of SsoPriSL to promote strand annealing. SsoPriSL catalyzed PADT with either dNTPs or rNTPs as the substrates but preferred the latter. The enzyme remained active in PADT but became inefficient in primer synthesis in vitro when temperature was raised from 55°C to 70°C. Our results suggest that SsoPriSL is capable of bridging noncomplementary DNA ends and, therefore, may serve a role in double-strand DNA break repair in Archaea. © 2011 The Author(s).',\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine the optimal dose and time window for the neuroprotective effect of VEGF when administrated after focal ischemia/reperfusion injury in rabbits. Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. In a dose response experiment, low (1.25 ng/μL), middle (2.5 ng/μL) and high (5.0 ng/μL) doses of VEGF were administered 2 h after MCAO by the route of perifocal region. The VEGF at a dose of middle (2.5 ng/μL) displayed excellent effects on neuroprotective efficacy for focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. In another experiment, 2.5 ng/μL VEGF was administered at times varying from 2 to 8 h after MCAO. Infarct volume, water content and neurological deficits were significantly reduced when VEGF was given at 2 and 3 h after injury. The protective effect was less when the same dose was given at the later times. Thus, the present findings indicated that VEGF reduced ischemic neuronal danger with a therapeutic time window within the first 3 h of transient MCAO and may be useful in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in humans. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show the maximum 20 minutes active power fluctuation rate of wind power output can be reduced from 61.7% to 9.9% by a relatively small capacity of ESS determined by the presented method. © 2012 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.',\n",

It includes the method of security label range and the method of taint propagation. The former lacks the support for a less proviledge subject, and the latter has a known covert channels. In this paper, a model called generalized taint propagation model (GTPM) is proposed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of operating systems. It inherits the least privilege characteristic of taint propagation model (TPM), expands the semantics of TPM to close the known covert channels, and introduces declassification and decontamination capacities of subjects to avoid accumulating contamination.

In these systems, it is common for a peer to join a swarm repeatedly, which can introduce substantial bias for lifespan modeling and prediction.

In the SN, the transmitter has to communicate with the receiver with the help of the hybrid relays which use cooperative beamforming to retransmit data. The relays will select amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) according to the signal to interference pulse noise ratio (SINR). The aim of this paper is to maximize the received SINR in the SN with different power constraints and the QoS requirement of the primary user (PU). Numerical results compare the performance of the SN between relays with beamforming and relays without beamforming which indicates that the gap between them is related to the maximum interference power at primary destination, while is irrelevant to maximum the total transmitted power of the relays. Besides there is a tradeoff between the performance of the SN and the number of the relays. © 2012 IEEE.',\n",

       " 'lBSUctgx': {'abstract': 'Regular expression (RegEx) matching has been widely used in various networking and security applications. Despite much effort on this important problem, it remains a fundamentally difficult problem. DFA-based solutions can achieve high throughput, but require too much memory to be executed in high speed SRAM. NFA-based solutions require small memory, but are too slow. In this paper, we propose RegexFilter, a prefiltering approach. The basic idea is to generate the RegEx print of RegEx set and use it to prefilter out most unmatched items. There are two key technical challenges: the generation of RegEx print and the matching process of RegEx print. The generation of RegEx is tricky as we need to tradeoff between two conflicting goals: filtering effectiveness, which means that we want the RegEx print to filter out as many unmatched items as possible, and matching speed, which means that we want the matching speed of the RegEx print as high as possible. To address the first challenge, we propose some measurement tools for RegEx complexity and filtering effectiveness, and use it to guide the generation of RegEx print. To address the second challenge, we propose a fast RegEx print matching solution using Ternary Content Addressable Memory. We implemented our approach and conducted experiments on real world data sets. Our experimental results show that RegexFilter can speedup the potential throughput of RegEx matching by 21.5 times and 20.3 times for RegEx sets of Snort and L7-Filter systems, at the cost of less than 0.2 Mb TCAM chip. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.',\n",

From a systems biology perspective, Proteins/genes interactions encode the key mechanisms distinguishing disease and health, and such mechanisms can be uncovered through network analysis. An effective network analysis tool should integrate different content-specific PPI databases into a comprehensive network format with a user-friendly platform to identify key functional modules/pathways and the underlying mechanisms of disease and toxicity. Results: atBioNet integrates seven publicly available PPI databases into a network-specific knowledge base. Knowledge expansion is achieved by expanding a user supplied proteins/genes list with interactions from its integrated PPI network. The statistically significant functional modules are determined by applying a fast network-clustering algorithm (SCAN: a Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks). The functional modules can be visualized either separately or together in the context of the whole network. Integration of pathway information enables enrichment analysis and assessment of the biological function of modules. Three case studies are presented using publicly available disease gene signatures as a basis to discover new biomarkers for acute leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and breast cancer. The results demonstrated that atBioNet can not only identify functional modules and pathways related to the studied diseases, but this information can also be used to hypothesize novel biomarkers for future analysis.Conclusion: atBioNet is a free web-based network analysis tool that provides a systematic insight into proteins/genes interactions through examining significant functional modules.

In this paper, we investigated that whether specific miRNAs were co-expressed in the serum and tissue of breast cancer (BC) patients as novel biomarkers by SOLiD sequencing. Methods: Different miRNA expression profiles of serum and tissue in breast cancer patients and control subjects were obtained by NGS -SOLiD sequencing. Real-time PCR was used to selected and validated candidate miRNA-biomarkers. Novel miRNAs were predicted by computational pipeline, and validated by Northern blot analysis. Results: Of genome-wide miRNA analysis using SOLiD sequencing, 7 miRNAs were found to be co-upregulated (i.e., miR-103, miR-23a, miR-29a, miR-222, miR-23b, miR-24 and miR-25). miR-222 was significantly increased in the serum of BC patients by further validation(P < 0.05), which may be a useful biomarker for differentiating BC patients from controls with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area 0.67 of (95% CI = 0.5649 to 0.7775). A novel miRNA, named miR-BS1 was preliminarily identified and validated. Pre-miR-BS1 has a characteristic secondary structure. Mature miR-BS1 expression was detected in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Through gene ontology analysis, predicted target genes of miR-BS1, such as FOXO3 and KRAS, were involved in cancer-related signaling pathway. Conclusions: This study presented a connection between serum- and tissue- based miRNA of breast cancer which suggested that serum-miRNAs may be potential biomarkers for BC detection. And next-generation sequencing will provide a robust platform for miRNA profilings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

It is found from the comparisons that the LES with an eddy-viscosity subgrid scale (SGS) model over-predicts the space-time correlations than the DNS. The overpredictions are further quantified by the integral scales of directional correlations and convection velocities. A physical argument for the overprediction is provided that the eddy-viscosity SGS model alone does not includes the backscatter effects although it correctly represents the energy dissipations of SGS motions. This argument is confirmed by the recently developed elliptic model for space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows. It suggests that enstrophy is crucial to the LES prediction of spacetime correlations. The random forcing models and stochastic SGS models are proposed to overcome the overpredictions on space-time correlations. © The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.',\n",

       " 'Fm4ispYE': {'abstract': \"In this paper, we investigate the problem of the multi-user uplink scheduling in cognitive radio cellular network. The objective is to maximize the system throughput, while protecting the QoS of primary user (PU) from being affected by cognitive user (CU). Here, PU's QoS is represented by its rate outage probability and it also reflects on the interference temperature (IT). It is equivalent to say that CUs can increase transmit power to enhance the system performance as long as PU's outage probability does not exceed the predefined threshold. We assume that the cognitive base station (CBS) is equipped with M antennas and all CUs has one antenna that means CBS can at most allow M CUs to access simultaneously. We focus on user scheduling schemes for this uplink of multiple user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system in cognitive radio network (CRN). Meanwhile, we formulate the water-filling power allocation problem at that condition. The first scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the system throughput through utilizing the multi-user diversity and spatial multiplexing gain. Due to the first algorithm which does not take the fairness among CUs into account, so we propose the second scheduling algorithm with considering fairness among CUs. It provides a satisfactory tradeoff between maximizing the system performance and achieving fairness among CUs. Finally, these proposed algorithms are validated through extensive simulations.\",\n",

Previous grouping algorithms are heuristic or are done by brute-force, which have poor grouping results. This paper analyzes the reasons of states explosion and summarizes conflicting relationship among regular expressions of some types. When conflicts are non-negative and independent, the optimum k-grouping problem of regular expression sets can be reduced to the maximum k-cut problem, which is NP-hard. Based on the idea of local searching, a new grouping algorithm named GRELS is introduced to solve the problem efficiently, which is 1/(1-1/k) -approximation for maximum k-cut problem.

As a result, training examples in data streams can be very diverse and it is very hard to learn accurate models with efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that first categorizes diverse training examples into four types and assign learning priorities to them. Then, we derive four learning cases based on the proportion and priority of the different types of training examples. Finally, for each learning case, we employ one of the four SVM-based training models: classical SVM, semi-supervised SVM, transfer semi-supervised SVM, and relational . k-means transfer semi-supervised SVM.

Despite much effort on this important problem, it remains a fundamentally difficult problem. DFA-based solutions are efficient in time but inefficient in memory, while NFA-based solutions are memory-efficient but time-inefficient. This poster provides a new solution named EFA (Excl-deterministic Finite Automata) to address the problem by excluding cancerogenic states from active state sets. The cancerogenic states are identified based on conflict relations. We make an evaluation of EFA with real RegExes and traffic traces.

Nevertheless, the related accuracy issues on early classification are still unclear when forged packets exist. The performance of such mechanism under malicious environment, where sophisticated forged data packets injection techniques are presented, had not been addressed. This work aims to touch the above issues, especially when forged packets are inserted before actual application transaction started. Our contributions are two-folded: (1) confirm the discrimination power of early classification as revealed by previous study; (2) explore it's accuracy vulnerability to forged packets - the experiments on both simulated and real SSH tunnel traces show the accuracy declines when forged packets are injected.

In 2010, Smith et al developed and internally validated models for predicting in-hospital mortality based on Get With the Guidelines-Stroke program data. We demonstrate the applicability of this Get With the Guidelines risk model in Chinese patients. Methods-The prognostic model was used to predict survival in 7015 patients with acute ischemic stroke from China National Stroke Registry data set. Model discrimination was quantified by calculating C statistic. To clarify the role of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), we also calculated the C statistics for NIHSS alone and for the model without NIHSS. Results-The C statistic was 0.867 (95% CI, 0.839-0.895) through the Get With the Guidelines risk model, suggesting good discrimination in the China National Stroke Registry. The model without NIHSS produced significantly lower C statistic (0.735; 95% CI, 0.701-0.770; P<0.001), indicating the important role of NIHSS in the prediction of survival. Furthermore, a model with NIHSS alone also provided significant discrimination (C statistic, 0.847; 95% CI, 0.816-0.879). A plot of observed versus predicted mortality showed excellent model calibration in the external validation sample from the China National Stroke Registry. Conclusions-The Get With the Guidelines risk model could correctly predict in-hospital mortality in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke. In addition, the NIHSS provides substantial incremental information on a patient's short-term mortality risk and is the strongest predictor of mortality. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.\",\n",

However, little is known about these miRNA pairs, especially for their distributions in different animal species. We herein present systematic analysis of them in human, mouse and rat miRNAs, and their expression patterns based on deep sequencing datasets. Methods and results: The phenomenon of miRNA-miRNA interaction could be detected in different animal species. The common miRNAs pairs were found across species. These miRNA pairs could form miRNA:miRNA duplex with complete complementary structure, and were prone to be located on specific chromosomes. They might be homologous miRNA genes (especially in human), or clustered in a gene cluster (especially in rat), or simultaneously detected in different genomic regions due to multicopy pre-miRNAs. Remarkably, some miRNA pairs, located in different genomic regions, also showed complementarity as well as endogenous sense/antisense miRNAs. Based on published deep sequencing datasets, one member of miRNA pairs always was abundantly expressed, whereas another was quite rare. Rare common target mRNAs of these miRNA pairs were predicted. Conclusions: Interaction between miRNAs and significant expression divergence implied complex potential mutual regulatory pattern in the miRNA world.

The recursive prediction error (RPE) algorithm based on autoregressive (AR) model has been proven to be more attractive to traditional approaches. However, it adapts too fast in double-talk which may cause the algorithm to diverge. A variable step size (VSS) approach is developed to tackle the problem. On the assumption that prediction error is more than 10 times smaller than microphone signal when the adaptive filter has converged, the step size is adjusted adaptively according to the energies of near-end, far-end and prediction error signals. The experimental results show that our algorithm, compared with original RPE algorithm, the performance in double-talk is improved more than 8 dB while no any performance losses in single-talk and echo path change cases. © 2012.

To solve this problem, the mathematical models of the converter and its control system is established firstly. The control parameters designing via classical control theory is followed. This is continued with analyzing the cause of the voltage fluctuations. Theoretical analysis points out that the voltage fluctuations can not be completely suppressed or eliminated just via parameters design and steady-state feedforward compensation. As a consequence, we propose an improved control strategy by setting a first derivative element in series to the steady-state feedforward compensation to compensate for the delay of the response. Experimental results indicate that the proposed feedforward compensation method can effectively suppress transient voltage fluctuations, and speed up system dynamic response. © 2012 IEEE.',\n",

Compared with the traditional network, spectrum utilization in CRN will be greatly improved.

So the quality of experience (QoE) can reflect the performance of network more comprehensive than QoS. In this paper, we studied a multi-user beamforming problem in CRN and designed a QoE provisioning model based on a specific QoS-QoE mapping scheme with a comprehensive consideration of techniques in physical layer and the key indicator of performance assessment.

In this paper, we propose ProDecoder, a network trace based protocol message format inference system that exploits the semantics of protocol messages without the executable code of application protocols. ProDecoder is based on the key insight that the n-grams of protocol traces exhibit highly skewed frequency distribution that can be leveraged for accurate protocol message format inference. In ProDecoder, we first discover the latent relationship among n-grams by first grouping protocol messages with the same semantics and then inferring message formats by keyword based clustering and cluster sequence alignment. We implemented and evaluated ProDecoder to infer message format specifications of SMB (a binary protocol) and SMTP (a textual protocol). Our experimental results show that ProDecoder accurately parses and infers SMB protocol with 100% precision and recall. For SMTP, ProDecoder achieves approximately 95% precision and recall. © 2012 IEEE.',\n",

Several morphing strategies have been proposed as promising approaches, very few works, however, have investigated their impact on the actual traffic classification performance. This work sets out to fulfill this gap from an empirical study point of view. It takes into account different morphing strategies exerted on packet size and/or inter-arrival time. The results show that not all morphing strategies can effectively obfuscate traffic classification. Different morphing strategies perform distinctively, among which the integration of packet size and inter arrival time morphing is the best, and the packet size based method is the worst. The three classifiers also exhibit distinct robustness to the morphing, with C4.5 being the most robust and Naive Bayes being the weakest. In addition, our study shows that classifiers can learn nontrivial information merely from the traffic direction patterns, which partially explains the weakness of packet size based morphing methods. © 2012 IEEE.',\n",

The state-of-the-art BT methods, which are mainly based on regression models, have two limitations. First, learning regression models for behavior targeting is difficult since user clicks are typically several orders of magnitude fewer than views. Second, the user interests are not fixed, but often transient and influenced by media and pop culture. In this paper, we propose to formulate behavior targeting as a classification problem. Specifically, we propose to use an SVM ensemble for behavior prediction. The challenge of using ensemble SVM for BT stems from the computational complexity (it takes 53 minutes in our experiments to predict behavior for 32 million users, which is inadequate for online application). To this end, we propose a fast ensemble SVM prediction framework, which builds an indexing structure for SVM ensemble to achieve sub-linear prediction time complexity. Experimental results on real-world large scale behavior targeting data demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms existing linear regression based BT models. © 2012 IEEE.',\n",

       " '6krp5I4c': {'abstract': 'mir-548 is a larger, poorly conserved primate-specific miRNA gene family. 69 human mir-548 genes located in almost all human chromosomes whose widespread distribution pattern implicates the evolutionary origin from transposable elements. Higher level of nucleotide divergence was detected between these human miRNA genes, which mainly derived from divergence of multicopy pre-miRNAs and homologous miRNA genes. Products of mir-548, miR-548-5p, and miR-548-3p showed inconsistent evolutionary patterns, which partly contributed to larger genetic distances between pre-miRNAs. \"Seed shifting\" events could be detected among miR-548 sequences due to various 5′ ends. The events led to shift of seed sequences and target mRNAs, even generated to new target mRNAs. Additionally, the phenomenon of miRNA:miRNA interaction in the miRNA gene family was found. The potential interaction between miRNAs may be contributed to dynamic miRNA expression profiles by complementarily binding events to form miRNA:miRNA duplex with 5′-/3′-overhangs. The miRNA gene family had important roles in multiple biological processes, including signaling pathways and some cancers. The potential abundant roles and functional implication further led to the larger and poorly conserved gene family with genetic variation based on transposable elements. The evolutionary pattern of the primate-specific gene family might contribute to dynamic expression profiles and regulatory network. © 2012 Tingming Liang et al.',\n",

Based on the parameters of an actual project and the strong impact of external excitations, the modal properties and dynamic responses are analyzed, and the cutterhead joint surface loads are obtained and treated by rain flow count. Numerical results indicate that the low natural frequencies are 57 Hz and 61 Hz, and natural vibration modes are pinions-motors rotational mode and translational-overturning coupled mode of cutterhead with inner ring gear correspondingly. Besides, the axial and radial amplitude of dynamic responses are 0.55 mm and 0.25 mm, respectively. The frequencies of radial, torsional, and overturning vibrations are predominantly concentrated in 112 Hz and 120 Hz, which indicates that the vibration responses of cutterhead are mainly affected by the external excitations. Finally, as the rain-flow counting results have shown, the standard deviation of the cutterhead joint surface loads in each direction increases by 12-15 times, compared with that of the external excitations; therefore inertia effect should be considered in cutterhead design. The proposed research lays a foundation for dynamic performance optimization and fatigue crack growth life assessment of cutterhead structure. © 2013 Wei Sun et al.',\n",

       " 'iMjbcMtm': {'abstract': 'The traditional motivation behind feature selection algorithms such as a genetic algorithm, a forward stepwise and a backward stepwise selections [1], is to find the best feature subset for a task using one particular learning algorithm. The idea is to select a optimal subset of attributes which are as representative as possible of the original data. However, it has been often found that no single classifier is entirely satisfactory for a particular task. Therefore, how to further improve the performance of these single systems on the basis of the previous optimal feature subset is a very important issue. Ensemble systems, also known as committees of classifiers, are composed of individual classifiers, organized in a parallel way and their outputs are combined in a combination method, which provides the final output of the system. Given the success of ensembles, ensembles allow us to get higher accuracy and sensitivity, which are often not achievable with single models. Based on the above, we propose a practical feature selection approach that is based on an optimal feature subset of a single CAD system, which is referred to as a multilevel optimal feature selection method (MOFS) in this paper. Through MOFS, we select the different optimal feature subsets in order to eliminate features that are redundant or irrelevant and obtain optimal features, and then a bagging ensemble with a MOFS method is proposed. Experimental results indicates that the accuracy of the bagging ensemble using a MOFS method is superior to that of a single CAD system and is also superior to that of the ensemble using an attribute selection algorithm based on ReliefF. © 2013 IEEE.',\n",

Traditional methods for measuring tree roots are labor intensive and destructive to nature, limiting quantitative and repeated assessments in long-term research. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provides a nondestructive method for measuring tree roots. This study investigates the feasibility of a GPR system with 500-MHz, 900-MHz, and 2-GHz measurement frequencies for detecting tree roots and estimating root biomass under controlled experimental conditions in a sandy area. After energy attenuation correction and velocity analysis, not only the individual root in subsurface is able to be located but also the parameters that correlate well with root biomass can be extracted from the processed GPR data. The major findings were as follows. First, both the amplitude and amplitude-area indices were confirmed to be more effective for estimating root biomass after attenuation-effect compensation. This result suggests that the calibration of GPR wave-attenuation effects and velocity changes with depth are helpful in estimating root biomass from GPR parameters. Second, the selection of GPR system frequency was mainly dependent on field conditions, particularly soil water content. Lower frequency was recommended for developing root biomass estimation model under varied soil conditions. Third, the new method based on the metal reflector experiment was effective and easy to perform in situ for attenuation-effect correction. © 1980-2012 IEEE.',\n",

Novel-miR sequence existed in Mus musculus, Drosophila grimshawi, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, Spodoptera frugiperda, Papio anubis, Salmo salar and so on. Then multiple sequence alignment (MSA) showed that sequence from 5 to 11. bp and 13 to 17. bp exhibited 100% similarity, where there is significant sequence conservation. Novel-miR showed similarity in the seed region with the known miR-3675-3p, indicating that these miRNAs are likely to belong to the same family and thus may share common biology. 3) novel-miR from MCF-7 and MB-MDA-231 was validated by Northern blot and detected in the serum and tissue samples of BC patients, respectively, by real-time PCR. The data showed that novel-miR was downregulated in the BC cancerous tissues and serum of breast cancer patients (P. <0.05). 4) transfection of novel-miR mimics into MCF-7 cell significantly inhibited cell growth detected by CCK-8 assay (P. <0.05). 5) to identify the mRNA targets of novel-miR, we performed a computational screen for genes with novel-miR complementary sites in their 3\\'-UTR using several open access databases. In addition, we used the CapitalBio® Molecule Annotation System V3.0 to perform gene ontology (GO) analysis on the target genes of novel-miR and specific biological process categories were enriched. 7 genes (CUL3, KRAS, ETS1, MNT, CNTN3, CCNK and FOXO3) which have a high prediction score and are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were chosen. 3\\'-UTR luciferase report assay suggested that miR-BS1 negatively regulated CNTN3.

A two-step one-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme is used by the primary network who utilizes the cognitive radio (CR) terminals as its relay nodes. Simultaneously, the cognitive information is transmitted by multiple CR terminals to the CR base station. In the first phase of AF relaying, the primary signal is forwarded by transmitter to the CRs/relays. The CRs/relays multiple the cognitive signals to the received primary signal and accomplish a distributed beamforming in the second phase of relaying. The authors aim at minimizing the CRs/relays power under the different signal to interference pulse noise ratio (SINR) restraints at the primary receiver and the cognitive base station (BS). The results can be seen from the simulation that the minimum CR terminals/relays power will increase with the rising of the SINR constraints. Besides, the performance difference between CR terminals/relays beamforming and without beam-forming is affected by the minimum CR terminals transmit power and the number of relays. Furthermore, with the number of CR terminals/relays rising, the performance difference is decreasing. © 2013 IEEE.',\n",

As a nondestructive geophysical tool for delineating buried features in shallow subsurface, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied for coarse root detection since 1999. This article reviews the state-of-knowledge of coarse root detection and quantification using GPR, and discusses its potentials, constraints, possible solutions, and future outlooks. Some useful suggestions are provided that can guide future studies in this field. Conclusions: The feasibility and accuracy of coarse root investigation by GPR have been tested in various site conditions (mostly in controlled conditions or within plantations) and for different plant species (mostly tree root systems). Thus far, single coarse root identification and coarse root system mapping have been conducted using GPR, including roots under pavements in urban environment. Coarse root diameter and biomass have been estimated from indexes extracted from root GPR radargrams. Coarse root development can be observed by repeated GPR scanning over time. Successful GPR-based coarse root investigation is site specific, and only under suitable conditions can reliable measurements be accomplished. The best quality of root detection by GPR is achieved in well-drained and electrically-resistive soils (such as sands) under dry conditions. Numerous factors such as local soil conditions, root electromagnetic properties, and GPR antenna frequency can impact the reliability and accuracy of GPR detection and quantification of coarse roots. As GPR design, data processing software, field data collection protocols, and root parameters estimation methods are continuously improved, this noninvasive technique could offer greater potential to study coarse roots. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.',\n",

We herein attempted to obtain the potential association between miRNA expression profile and breast cancer by applying high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs from seven paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples were sequenced. To determine the miRNA expression profiles in tissues and sera, another five equally pooled serum samples from 20 patients and 30 normal women were sequenced. Despite a similar number in abundantly expressed miRNAs across samples, we detected varying miRNA expression profiles. Some miRNAs showed inconsistent or opposite dysregulation trends across different tumor tissues, including some abundantly expressed miRNA gene clusters and gene families. Wilcoxon sign-rank test for paired samples analysis revealed that abnormal miRNAs showed a higher level of variation across the seven tumor samples. We also completely surveyed abnormal miRNAs expressed in tumor and serum tissues in the mixed datasets based on the relative expression levels. Most of these miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in tumor samples, but nine abnormal miRNAs (miR-18a, 19a, 20a, 30a, 103b, 126, 126, 192, 1287) were consistently expressed in tumor tissues and serum samples. Based on experimentally validated target mRNAs, functional enrichment analysis indicated that these abnormal miRNAs and miRNA groups (miRNA gene clusters and gene families) have important roles in multiple biological processes. Dynamic miRNA expression profiles, various abnormal miRNA profiles and complexity of the miRNA regulatory network reveal that the miRNA expression profile is a potential biomarker for classifying or detecting human disease. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.',\n",

Its dysregulation may be associated with risk of some human cancers. The microRNA (miRNA) members are identified in the three gene families: mir-17, mir-19 and mir-25. Herein we attempted to understand the evolutionary processes and patterns in vertebrates. The three miRNA gene families showed difference in distribution, number of miRNA genes and clustered miRNA genes in the five animal species. Compared to other related gene clusters, mir-17-92 cluster was well-conserved and had more abundant roles in multiple biological processes. These clustered miRNAs showed inconsistent nucleotide divergence patterns across different animal species, even between homologous miRNA genes. Simultaneously, they also indicated inconsistent expression patterns although they were co-transcribed as a polycistronic transcript. Phylogenetic tree based on human pre-miRNA sequences showed that mir-19 gene family was an older miRNA species, while tree based on miRNA gene cluster indicated evolutionary positions of different animal species. The study shows dynamic evolution of the mir-17-92 gene cluster and related miRNA gene families across vertebrates, which may be derived from potential functional implication. miRNA gene cluster should be a better phylogenetic marker than a single miRNA gene to reveal functional and evolutionary relationships. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.',\n",

So preventing youngsters from accessing pornography information, while not affecting the freedom of expressions in adults, has become a reasonable yet challenging alternative.

However, ReaxFF MD can be approximately 10-50 times slower than classical MD due to its explicit modeling of bond forming and breaking, the dynamic charge equilibration at each time-step, and its one order smaller time-step than the classical MD, all of which pose significant computational challenges in simulation capability to reach spatio-temporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds. The very recent advances of graphics processing unit (GPU) provide not only highly favorable performance for GPU enabled MD programs compared with CPU implementations but also an opportunity to manage with the computing power and memory demanding nature imposed on computer hardware by ReaxFF MD. In this paper, we present the algorithms of GMD-Reax, the first GPU enabled ReaxFF MD program with significantly improved performance surpassing CPU implementations on desktop workstations.

A filtering query may connect to several different filters and a filter may connect to several different filtering queries. An open problem in such a filtering scenario is how to order the filters in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods are based on a greedy strategy which orders the filters according to three factors of the filters, i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there are still some problems that haven't been addressed yet. Firstly, the selectivity factor is set empirically, which can not adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Secondly, the relationships among the three factors are not considerably explored. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an adaptive hierarchal ordering (AHO) algorithm which executes a two-stage ordering strategy. In the first ordering stage, AHO clusters all the filters according to their popularities and costs factors. In the second stage, for each cluster all the filters are then ordered according to their selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AHO method outperforms other simple filtering methods.\",\n",

Mixed serum samples from the different stages of CWP and the control samples were subjected to deep sequencing by applying next-generation sequencing technology. Samples at different disease stages exhibited inconsistent miRNA expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNA profiles. Generally, these miRNAs were dynamically expressed across the different disease stages and showed various relative expression levels. Some miRNAs (such as miR-18a*, 149, 222 and 671-3p) were consistently up-regulated or down-regulated in the different stages of CWP samples. Most of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs showed a down-regulation trend. Differentially expressed miRNAs were also subjected to pairwise comparison between the different stages. Some miRNAs showed significant inconsistent expression trends across the three stages, although they were not significantly dysregulated based on the control sample. Furthermore, a series of special miRNAs organized into miRNA gene clusters and gene families were also surveyed for aberrant expression (such as mir-200 gene family and mir-222 gene cluster). According to experimentally validated target mRNAs of the aberrantly and abundantly expressed miRNAs, functional enrichment analysis suggests that these miRNAs play important roles in various biological processes, including lung tumorigenesis. In summary, we demonstrated that aberrantly expressed circulating miRNAs showed dynamic expression patterns across diseased samples, which suggests that these miRNAs may have critical roles in the occurrence and development of CWP. In addition, some significantly dysregulated miRNAs may be potential non-invasive diagnosis biomarkers based on further study. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\",\n",

To achieve reliable and economic operations of a standalone microgrid, in addition to the consideration of utilization of renewable resources, the lifetime characteristics of a battery energy storage system also need to be fully investigated. In this paper, in order to realize the economic operation of a recently developed standalone microgrid on Dongfushan Island in China, an optimization model including battery life loss cost, operation and maintenance cost, fuel cost, and environmental cost is established to obtain a set of optimal parameters of operation strategy. Considering the lifetime characteristics of lead-acid batteries, a multiobjective optimization to minimize power generation cost and to maximize the useful life of lead-acid batteries has been achieved via the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The results show that the proposed method can optimize the system operations under different scenarios and help users obtain the optimal operation schemes of the actual microgrid system. © 2013 IEEE.',\n",

The state-of-the-art methods for CVPs discovery are either computationally expensive or have complicated constraints. In this paper, we formulate CVPs discovery as a graph matching problem, depending on pairwise geometric compatibility between feature correspondences. To efficiently find all CVPs, we propose a novel framework which consists of three components: Preliminary Initialization Optimization (PIO), Guided Expansion (GE) and Post Agglomerative Combination (PAC). PIO gets the initial CVPs and reduces the search space of CVPs discovery, based on the internal homogeneity of CVPs. Then, GE anchors on the initializations and gradually explores them, to find more and more correct correspondences. Finally, to reduce false and miss detection, PAC refines the discovery result in an agglomerative way. Experiments and applications conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.',\n",

Our aim was to determine the accuracy of the iScore in patients with ischemic stroke in China. METHODS - : The iScore was used to predict 30-day mortality rate in 11 656 patients and 1-year mortality rate in 11 051 patients with acute ischemic stroke. These patients were identified from the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR) data set. Model discrimination was quantified by calculating the C statistic. The calibration was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS - : The 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 5.4% and 14.3%, respectively. The C statistics were 0.825 (95% confidence interval, 0.807-0.843) for 30-day mortality and 0.822 (95% confidence interval, 0.810-0.833) for 1-year mortality. The plots of observed versus predicted mortality rates showed excellent model calibration in the external validation samples from the CNSR (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.925 for 30-day and 0.998 for 1-year mortality; both P<0.0001).

Weighting factor is chosen to balance these two intensity fitting terms, which can be calculated automatically by local entropy. The level set regularization term is to replace contour curve to find the minimum of the energy function. Particularly, structure tensor is applied to describe the image, which overcomes the disadvantage of image feature without structure information. The experimental results show that our proposed method can segment image efficiently whether it presents intensity inhomogeneity or not and wherever the initial contour is. Moreover, compared with the Chan-Vese model and local binary fitting model, our proposed model not only handles better intensity inhomogeneity, but also is less sensitive to the location of initial contour. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.',\n",

Due to the diversity in the motivations, previous work in this field mostly focuses on designing data holder's data distribution and insider tracing algorithms, with little consideration of malicious insiders' leakage strategies. In this paper, the traitors tracing problem is modeled as an incremental refining multi-step process. For each step, a metric is proposed to measure the efficiency of current tracing status. Theoretical and simulating analysis shows that malicious insiders can adopt sophisticated leakage strategies, which makes it difficult to distinguish them from others and leads to more innocent users involved as suspects. Thus it is important for the data holder to figure out the insiders' leakage strategies and adopt proper tracing scheme to improve the refining process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.\",\n",

And nowadays, academic researches on CAPTCHA, including designing friendly but secure CAPTCHA systems and breaking existing CAPTCHA systems, are becoming a more and more hot topic. Breaking an existing CAPTCHA system can help to perfect its designs and therefore to improve its security. In this paper, ESBDA, an Ellipse-Shaped Blobs Detection Algorithm, is proposed to detect the ellipse-shaped blobs used in Facebook CAPTCHA scheme, which can be used to break the Facebook CAPTCHA system. The approach is based on detecting the contour of the ellipse-shaped blobs on the basis of erosion and dilation technologies. And the experimental results show that ESBDA can effectively remove the noised ellipse-shaped blobs in the Facebook CPATCHA scheme. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.',\n",

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we use the KDDCUP'12 behavior targeting data, issued by the Tecent company in China, as the test bed.

       " '3M3xxkd0': {'abstract': \"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial negative regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Next-generation sequencing technologies have identified a series of miRNA variants (named isomiRs). In this study, paralogous isomiR assemblies (from the miRNA locus) were systematically analyzed based on data acquired from deep sequencing data sets. Evolutionary analysis of paralogous (members in miRNA gene family in a specific species) and orthologues (across different animal species) miRNAs was also performed. The sequence diversity of paralogous isomiRs was found to be similar to the diversity of paralogous and orthologues miRNAs. Additionally, both isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNAs were implicated in 5' and 3' ends (especially 3' ends), nucleotide substitutions, and insertions and deletions. Generally, multiple isomiRs can be produced from a single miRNA locus, but most of them had lower enrichment levels, and only several dominant isomiR sequences were detected. These dominant isomiR groups were always stable, and one of them would be selected as the most abundant miRNA sequence in specific animal species. Some isomiRs might be consistent to miRNA sequences in some species but not the other. Homologous miRNAs were often detected in similar isomiR repertoires, and showed similar expression patterns, while dominant isomiRs showed complex evolutionary patterns from miRNA sequences across the animal kingdom. These results indicate that the phenomenon of multiple isomiRs is not a random event, but rather the result of evolutionary pressures. The existence of multiple isomiRs enables different species to express advantageous sequences in different environments. Thus, dominant sequences emerge in response to functional and evolutionary pressures, allowing an organism to adapt to complex intra- and extra-cellular events. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",

       " 'IRg23E50': {'abstract': 'Background and aims: The GPR indices used for predicting root biomass are measures of root radar reflectance. However, root radar reflectance is highly correlated with root water content. The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of root water content on GPR-based root biomass estimation and to develop more reliable approaches to quantify root biomass using GPR. Methods: Four hundred nine roots of five plant species in a sandy area of northern China were examined to determine the general water content range of roots in sandy soils. Two sets of GPR simulation scenarios (including 492 synthesized radargrams in total) were then conducted to compare the changes of root radar signal and the accuracies of root biomass estimation by GPR at different root gravimetric water content levels. In the field, GPR transects were scanned for Ulmus pumila roots buried in sandy soils with three antenna center frequencies (0.5, 0.9, and 2.0 GHz). The performance of two new GPR-based root biomass quantification approaches (one using time interval GPR index and the other using a non-linear regression model) was then tested. Results: All studied roots exhibited a broad range of gravimetric water content (>125 %), with the water contents of most roots ranging from 90 % to 150 %. Both field experiments and forward simulations indicated that 1) waveforms of root radar reflection, radar-reflectance related GPR indices, and root biomass estimation accuracy were all affected by root water content; and 2) using time interval index and establishing a nonlinear regression model of root biomass on GPR indices improved the accuracy of root biomass estimation, decreasing the prediction error (RMSE) by 4 to 30 % under field conditions. Conclusions: The magnitude of GPR indices depends on both root biomass and root water content, and root water content affects root biomass estimation using GPR indices. Using a linear regression model of root biomass on radar-reflectance related GPR index for root biomass estimation would only be feasible for roots with a relative narrow range of water content (e.g., when gravimetric water contents of studied roots vary within 20 %). Appropriate GPR index and regression models should be selected based on the water content range of roots. The new protocol of root biomass quantification by GPR presented in this study improves the accuracy of root biomass estimation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.',\n",

For individual anomalies, the features HNF were extracted, and if the reconstruction error based on sparse representation is beyond the predefined threshold, surprise computation is used for a second detection to judge a false alarm induced by some noise.

The algorithm utilized the prediction information decoded from the original compressed video to re-encode it, and then embedded concealed data into 4×4 blocks inside the I-frames during the new encoding process. Simulation results show that, while keeping the video quality relatively unchanged, the proposed scheme could be used to embed large amounts of concealed data into H. 264/AVC compressed videos without introducing too much bit stream increase.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain poorly known. Recently, circulating miRNAs are considered as potential useful noninvasive biomarkers. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in preeclamptic pregnancies compared with normal pregnancies. Methods. Maternal plasma miRNA expression profiles were detected by SOLiD sequencing. Differential expressions between mPE/sPE and control group were found. Next, four differentially expressed plasma miRNAs were chosen to validate their expression in other large scale samples by real-time PCR. Results. In terms of sequencing results, we identified that 51 miRNAs were differentially expressed. Four differentially expressed plasma miRNAs (miR-141, miR-144, miR-221, and miR-29a) were selected to validate the sequencing results. RT-PCR data confirmed the reliability of sequencing results. The further statistical analysis showed that maternal plasma miR-141 and miR-29a are significantly overexpressed in mPE (P < 0.05). Maternal plasma miR-144 is significantly underexpressed in mPE and sPE (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Results showed that there were differentially expressed maternal plasma miRNAs in patients with preeclampsia.

The objective of this study is to develop a theoretical forward simulation protocol of synthesizing root's GPR signal and test the feasibility of our proposed simulation protocol in evaluating the impacts of limiting factors on GPR-based root detection and quantification. Methods: The proposed forward simulation protocol was developed by integrating several existing numerical models, such as the Root Composition Model, the Root Dielectric Constant Model, the Root Electrical Conductivity Model, the Soil Dielectric Constant Model, the Soil Electrical Conductivity Model, and a newly-established model (Root Length-Biomass Model). Resolution and GPR index obtained from both field collected radargrams and corresponding simulations were compared to validate the accuracy of simulation. Results: Simulated radargrams exhibit similar resolution with that of the in situ collected. The same trends of root radar signals against different levels of root size, root water content, interval between roots, root depth, and antenna frequency were observed on both in situ radargrams and simulated radargrams. Strong correlations (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.96) were found between GPR indices extracted from the simulated data and those from the field collected data. Conclusions: Our proposed forward simulation is effective for assessing the impacts of limiting factors on root detection and quantification using GPR. This forward simulation protocol can be used to provide guidance for in situ GPR root investigation and can predict the accuracy of GPR-based root quantification under site-specific conditions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\",\n",

The problem is defined as, given a target user w, finding the top-k most influential nodes for the user. Different from existing influence maximization works which aim to find a small subset of nodes to maximize the spread of influence over the entire network (i.e., global optima), our problem aims to find a small subset of nodes which can maximize the influence spread to a given target user (i.e., local optima). The solution is critical for personalized services on social networks, where fully understanding of each specific user is essential. Although some global influence maximization models can be narrowed down as the solution, these methods often bias to the target node itself. To this end, in this paper we present a local influence maximization solution. We first provide a random function, with low variance guarantee, to randomly simulate the objective function of local influence maximization. Then, we present efficient algorithms with approximation guarantee. For online social network applications, we also present a scalable approximate algorithm by exploring the local cascade structure of the target user. We test the proposed algorithms on several real-world social networks. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Copyright 2013 ACM.',\n",

However, this method can only recognize known Trojan except up-to-date malicious software that has unknown signature code. Some other security tools requiring preinstalled on hosts detects Trojans by program behaviors. This paper proposes a novel medel to detect data stolen Trojans based on their network behaviors. It consists of three detectors: 1) keep-alive detector detects keep-alive packets or connections; 2) master-slave-connection detector tries to find master and slave connections and 3) mistake detector analyses the rate of download vs. upload and connection time for different protocol. The experiments show that this method is efficient in recognizing data stolenTrojans. This protyped system proves the possibility of detection Trojans from network. © 2013 The Authors.

Results show that the numerical model can be used for revealing common failure modes and mechanisms. the increase of aggregate volume fraction can improve concrete ductility, while at the same time, lower its strength, which coincides with existing experimental results.

Recently, Tor nodes from Tor families (referred to as family nodes) have played an increasingly important role and caused significant influence on the Tor network. However, existing research about Tor mostly focuses on the entire Tor network without much consideration about the difference between family nodes and the others. In order to analyze family nodes' contribution to the entire Tor network as well as their influence, this paper distinguishes family nodes from the others, and gives an empirical analysis of family nodes based on the live Tor network data of 3 years. Results show that, family nodes compose a small but full functional subset of Tor nodes; and compared with the other Tor nodes, they can provide relatively stable and high-performance service to Tor users. Furthermore, family nodes naturally form a hot area in the Tor network, relaying increasingly high-density traffic through a small number of nodes. Compared with random node targets, selective attacks focusing on family nodes can cause serious availability downgrade of the Tor network with much lower cost. © 2013 IEEE.\",\n",

To improve the dc bus voltage control dynamics, traditional approaches are mainly based on feeding forward the load or source power.

In this paper, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based dc bus voltage control is proposed, which does not need the remote measurement or communication with a true plug-and-play feature. Based on this observer, a novel dc bus voltage control scheme with pulse-width-modulation (PWM) dead-time compensation is developed. The proposed method can suppress the transient fluctuations of dc bus voltage, and improve the power quality in such a hybrid microgrid system.

Moreover, we present two algorithms based on the semantics, which can later be applied to next-n step prediction and anomaly detection. Experiments on real world data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. © Springer-Verlag 2013.',\n",

Based on the success of low-rank matrix recovery which has been applied to statistical learning, computer vision and signal processing, this paper presents a novel low-rank matrix recovery algorithm with discriminant regularization. Standard low-rank matrix recovery algorithm decomposes the original dataset into a set of representative basis with a corresponding sparse error for modeling the raw data. Motivated by the Fisher criterion, the proposed method executes low-rank matrix recovery in a supervised manner, i.e., taking the with-class scatter and between-class scatter into account when the whole label information is available. The paper shows that the formulated model can be solved by the augmented Lagrange multipliers, and provide additional discriminating ability to the standard low-rank models for improved performance. The representative bases learned by the proposed method are encouraged to be structural coherence within the same class, and as independent as possible between classes. Numerical simulations on face recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art alternatives. © Springer-Verlag 2013.',\n",

The simple greedy algorithm [14] achieves an approximation ratio of 1-1/e. The advanced CELF algorithm [16], by exploiting the sub modular property of the spread function, runs 700 times faster than the simple greedy algorithm on average. However, CELF is still inefficient [4], as the first iteration calls for N times of spread estimations (N is the number of nodes in networks), which is computationally expensive especially for large networks. To this end, in this paper we derive an upper bound function for the spread function. The bound can be used to reduce the number of Monte-Carlo simulation calls in greedy algorithms, especially in the first iteration of initialization. Based on the upper bound, we propose an efficient Upper Bound based Lazy Forward algorithm (UBLF in short), by incorporating the bound into the CELF algorithm. We test and compare our algorithm with prior algorithms on real-world data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that UBLF, compared with CELF, reduces more than 95% Monte-Carlo simulations and achieves at least 2-5 times speed-raising when the seed set is small. © 2013 IEEE.',\n",

       " '0eqCBR9X': {'abstract': 'As crucial negative regulatory molecules, small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), have been widely studied, especially for their functions and evolutions. Multiple miRNA variants, termed as isomiRs, are recently detected and identified from a given miRNA locus due to alterative and imprecise cleavage of Drosha and Dicer. Compared to the canonical miRNA sequence, these isomiRs may be found various 5\\' and/or 3\\' ends (various 3\\' ends are more popular), 3\\' additional non-template nucleotides, 5\\' and seed modification events. Similarly, miRNA sequences in different animal species also show diversity as well as species specificity. The miRNA sequences in different animal species may be involved in different length distributions, 5\\' and/or 3\\' ends, transition/transversion and insertion/deletion. From a given miRNA locus, internal multiple isomiRs and various miRNA sequences across species are quite similar and have close relationships. Indeed, they also implicate potential functional and evolutionary relationships. By applying high-throughput sequencing technique, multiple isomiRs from a given miRNA locus can be identified with different sequence counts, length distributions and various expression patterns, although isomiR repertoire and their expression patterns always are stable across different tissues, samples and even animal species. Most isomiRs were 3\\' isomiRs which had the same seed sequences, while 5\\' isomiRs were found to have new seed sequences via the phenomenon of \"seed shifting\". Many miRNAs were detected a set of isomiRs, in which 1-3 were abundant isomiRs characterized by a narrow length distribution (20-23 nt) due to dominant cleavage. Indeed, specific miRNA sequences have been identified in specific animal species through classical experimental validation. The annotated miRNA sequence is always derived from the most abundantly expressed isomiR, which is prone to be detected by traditional detection. Therefore, we speculate that the most dominant isomiR is not randomly selected, but is strictly regulated by complex regulatory network from selection and evolutionary pressures. Various miRNA sequences can unveil dynamic evolutionary processes across different animal species (cross-species) and across different miRNAs (within species), especially simultaneously involved in the diversity of pre-miRNA and pri-miRNA sequences. Furthermore, more miRNA* sequences, ever as passenger strands of miRNA sequences, are identified as active and functional miRNA sequences. These potential functional miRNA* sequences and potential more functional isomiRs (such as 5\\' isomiRs with novel seed sequences by changing 5\\' ends) will complicate miRNA-mRNA and miRNA-miRNA interaction, and enrich coding-non-coding RNA regulatory network. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Offline calculation firstly build two levels of grids for vector road network, and then combined similarity could be pre-calculated offline which takes both the distance from center of each cell to every candidate matching road segment or node and traffic direction of every candidate matching road segment into account. According to the value of the difference between the maximal combined similarity and the second largest combined similarity, the related road segment or road node whose combined similarity clearly dominated could be stored in advance as attribute value of the cell in second level grid. When online map matching is implemented for every real time GPS point, the cell in the second level of grid where the GPS point fall within could be firstly instantly got, and then measure of path accessibility from previous GPS point to current GPS point could be quickly determined by means of two-way forward and backward method, and then final matching result of real time GPS point that is the attribute value stored in advance could be instantly obtained according to the value of path accessibility. Experiments on massive floating car in Shenzhen city show that the matching speed of this method is twice as fast as the matching speed of local map matching method, and it only occupied about 8 M storage space on storing two level of grids and its attribute values which could be read into memory once, and it took about 32 hours to finish offline calculation for the whole Shenzhen road network, however, once offline calculation is finished, it was able to provide a long history service to online map match.',\n",

Attack graph model is frequently used to describe the causal relationships among the steps in multiple attack progress, yet the uncertainty of events represented by the current observations is rarely considered in calculating the optimal security hardening measures, neither the impact of the probability of the attack success is depicted from the angle of probability after the implementation of the security measures. In this paper, we discuss completly three kinds of uncertainty in attack graph, and add the security hardening nodes into the probability attack graph model based on previous studies, and clarify the influence of the transition probability by security hardening measures. For the first time we put forward measures probability attack graph (MPAG) and apply it to the calculation of the optimal security hardening measures for insider threat risk analysis and mitigation. Based on this model, we prove that the calculation for optimal security hardening measures is an NP-hard problem, furthermore, we propose a greedy algorithm to calculate dynamically the approximate optimal security hardening measures set. Finally the paper proves in real network environment that the algorithm can calculate the approximate optimal security hardening measures set under certain cost constraints, given current observables sequence and the responding confidence probability.',\n",

Structural analysis of Ssh10b in complex with a 25-bp RNA duplex containing local distortions reveals that Ssh10b binds the two RNA strands symmetrically as a tetramer with each dimer bound asymmetrically to a single RNA strand. Amino acid residues involved in double-stranded RNA binding are similar, but non-identical, to those in dsDNA binding. The dimer-dimer interaction mediated by the intermolecular β-sheet appears to facilitate the destabilization of base pairing in the secondary structure of RNA.

Here, we attempted to perform an integrative analysis of miRNA-lncRNA in mammals to reveal their potential evolutionary relationships in transcriptional regulation network. The lncRNA of H19 gene includes an internal small non-coding RNA, miR-675. The H19 gene was conserved as well as the neighbor Igf2 coding gene and internal miR-675 gene, although they were involved in various location distributions and phylogenetic relationships. Both miR-675-5p/3p have been reported as potential negative regulatory molecules, but the canonical miRNA was more conserved than the passenger strand. These results implicated that the imprinted coding and non-coding gene cluster indicated similar evolutionary patterns. The lncRNA and internal miRNAs may have versatile roles in multiple biological processes, including in tumorigenesis as potential ncRNA regulatory molecules. The phylogenetical conservation of the imprinted cluster may be also derived from the functional implications and evolutionary pressures.

While previous works on semantic relation automatic acquisition relied on annotated text corpus, it is still unclear how to develop more generic methods to meet the needs of identifying related event pairs and extracting event-arguments (especially the predicate, subject and object). Motivated by this limitation, we develop a three-phased approach that acquires causality from the Web text. First, we use explicit connective markers (such as \"because\") as linguistic cues to discover causal related events. Next, we extract the event-arguments based on local dependency parse trees of event expressions. At the last step, we propose a statistical model to measure the potential causal relations. The results of our empirical evaluations on a large-scale Web text corpus show that (a) the use of local dependency tree extensively improves both the accuracy and recall of event-arguments extraction task, and (b) our measure improves the traditional PMI method. © The Authors.

Unlike previous event detection algorithms which do not distinguish between global events and local events, we believe it is important that we make that distinction as certain events can only be meaningful if they are placed in specific context while other events may arouse the interests of general users. The main contribution of this paper is that we've customized hot events detection by employing local community detection mechanisms and established a very clear concept for global hot events and local hot events. We present in this paper a multi-layer event detection algorithm which constructs a four-stage event detection procedure that produces a relatively comprehensive description of events relevant to the unique makeup and different interest of microblog users. Both the global hot events and local hot events we gathered are represented by a key tweet which contains sufficient information to depict a complete event. As a result of our algorithm's ability to precisely describe events which outperforms existing event detection algorithms, it is now possible for people to better understand public sentiment towards hot issues on microblogs. Experiments have shown that our multi-layer hot event detection algorithm can produce promising results in mining the interests of different communities, generating relevant event clusters and presenting meaningful events to community users. The most allround evaluation indicator F-value, which takes both precision and recall rate into account, has demonstrated that our algorithm outperforms the other three traditional approaches in detecting hot events. © The Authors.

In our problem setting, repeated activation exists and we aim to find a set of initial users, through which the maximal cumulative influence can be stimulated in a given time period. To describe the repeated activation behavior, we adopt the voter model to reflect the variation of activations over time. Under the voter model, we formulate the maximization problem and present an effective algorithm. We test and compare our method with heuristic algorithms on real-world data sets.

However, we recently observe that various malicious information, such as computer virus and rumors, are broadly spread via social networks. To restrict these malicious information, it is critical to develop effective method to discover the diffusion source nodes in social networks. Many pioneer works have explored the source node identification problem, but they all based on an ideal assumption that there is only a single source node, neglecting the fact that malicious information are often diffused from multiple sources to intentionally avoid network audit. In this paper, we present a multi-source locating method based on a given snapshot of partially and sparsely observed infected nodes in the network. Specifically, we first present a reverse propagation method to detect recovered and unobserved infected nodes in the network, and then we use community cluster algorithms to change the multi-source locating problem into a bunch of single source locating problems. At the last step, we identify the nodes having the largest likelihood estimations as the source node on the infected clusters.

Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013), buried root samples in a sand box were scanned from multiple cross angles between root orientation and GPR transecting line under controlled conditions. Changes in radar waveform parameter of roots to different cross angles were investigated.Results: Tanikawa et al. Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013) clarified that 1) the variation in amplitude area (a signal strength related waveform parameter) to different cross angles fitted a sinusoidal waveform; and 2) the impact of root orientation on root diameter estimation by GPR could be mathematically corrected by applying a grid transect survey. However, we found that the quantitative relationship established in Tanikawa et al. Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013) between amplitude area and cross angle was incorrect, and the application of a grid transect survey still underestimated root diameter.Conclusion: The change in amplitude area to cross angle between transecting line and root orientation fits a sinusoidal waveform but different to that reported in Tanikawa et al.

MAb ZCH-2B8a (2B8a) was a novel antibody generated in our laboratory, which presented potential to be a therapeutic agent for hematologic malignancies. Methods: We investigated the reactivity profile of 2B8a mAb, identified the targeting antigen by proteomic and genetic approaches and evaluated its potential to exert tumor cell killing. Results: 2B8a antigen was strictly expressed on lymph tissues and hematopoietic cells (mainly leukocytes), and was highly expressed on B-lineage leukemia cell lines and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from patients. 2B8a antibody was quickly internalized into the target cells once binding to the antigen, but was capable of killing tumor cells through complement dependent cytotoxicity. To identify the 2B8a antigen, the proteins of Raji cells were immunoprecipitated with 2B8a antibody and analyzed by mass spectrometry, which indicated that coronin-1a was a potential candidate. Then, coronin-1a gene was cloned from Raji cells, inserted into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+), and transfected into CHO cells. The intracellular 2B8a antigen level was significantly increased in the coronin-1a transfectant cell line. Conclusion: 2B8a mAb is a novel antibody targeting coronin-1a, which has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for B-lineage malignancies. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Its performance directly affects the precision and reliability of Micro Total Analysis Systems (μTAS), and it also plays a key role in the targeting transport of trace substances. The single and double chamber valveless micropumps with saw-tooth microchannel were designed. The saw-tooth diffuser/nozzle pipe was fabricated on chrome glass substrate using MEMS technology and the pump diaphragm was manufactured by PMMA material. The piezoelectric bimorph with cantilever beam was adopted as driving pump actuator and PDMS material as pump diaphragm. The valveless micropumps for both single and double chambers were formed with different saw-tooth structure parameters. The flow rate increased about 25 % when the sidewall of microchannel changed from smooth to saw-tooth, and with the driving voltage increasing, the positive and negative flow difference of saw-tooth diffuser/nozzle pipe increased significantly, so does the micro pump flow rate. The best diffused angle ? was determined by the microchannel length L of sawtooth diffuser/nozzle pipe, and the micro pump operated with its maximum flow rate only when the length-width ratio A reached the best value. The flow rate of a saw-tooth diffuser/nozzle valveless micropump with parallel double chambers increased approximately 30 % than that of a single chamber. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.',\n",

Its 3D skeleton data has less data and retains the key information, and the MCRF model has the advantage of being able to combine more features and utilizing adaptive contextual information. First, human activity was divided into global activity, arm activity, and leg activity. Several feature subsets were formed through more feature extraction. Then, CRF models were used on each feature subset to generate CRF units. Finally, all the CRF units were combined to produce the MCRF model which was utilized to recognize human activity.

The aims of the present study were to comprehensively survey and characterize non-template nucleotides (NTNs) and isomiR repertoires in miRNAs. Over 50\\xa0% of the NTNs were located in the 3′ ends (also termed 3′ additions), followed by the 5′ ends and adjacent positions to 5′ and 3′ ends. The similar distributions of NTNs and isomiR repertoires might be detected between homologous or clustered miRNAs. miRNA might be stably expressed based on the typical analysis, but its isomiRs might be strongly up- or down-regulated. IsomiRs with novel seed sequences were mainly derived from “seed shifting” events in 5′ isomiRs, NTNs in 5′ ends or in seed sequences. IsomiRs from a miRNA locus or homologous miRNA loci maybe have the same seed sequences, but they would have various enrichment levels and 3′ ends. Interestingly, isomiR species with novel seed sequences via NTNs in the seed region were always stably expressed. These novel seed sequences could lead to novel functional roles through driving the potential novel target mRNAs. Integrated predicted target mRNAs and further microarray validation showed that these isomiRs have versatile biological roles. Collectively, multiple isomiR products and miRNA maturation processes provide opportunities to perform versatile roles in the regulatory network, which further enriches and complicates the regulation of biological processes.',\n",

A computational approach can be of help for fully understanding the mechanisms and reaction pathways during PE pyrolysis in various industrial applications. In this paper, ReaxFF molecular dynamics was for the first time applied in simulating the pyrolysis of a High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) model system with 7216 atoms. Detailed reaction mechanisms and generation pathways of primary gas molecules were obtained by further analysis of the trajectories within a total of 250 ps simulation in NVT ensemble at 2000-3000 K using a newly created program, VARMD. The product profile and primary gas products evolution tendencies with temperature agree reasonably with the observations in Py-GC/MS experiments and literature data. The overall kinetics of ∼ C31 were analyzed and used to predict the reaction time for 90% weight loss of HDPE thermolysis that falls in around the reported time observed experimentally in the literatures. The reaction mechanisms based on the detailed reactions from the simulation trajectories are in broad agreement with what reported in literatures. The work presented here validates that ReaxFF MD is a promising method to help building a systematic understanding of the detailed chemical reactions in pyrolytic process for polymers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an integrated evolutionary analysis of human miRNA gene clusters and families was performed. Generally, miRNA gene clusters include 2-8 members, but some larger clusters have been found to have more members (over 40 miRNAs). 62.22% of them have been shown to be involved in homologous miRNA genes, including multicopy pre-miRNAs and sense/antisense homologous miRNAs. Multicopy pre-miRNAs can enrich the distribution and relationship between miRNA clusters and families. An miRNA family may be located in one or more clusters, and a cluster may be involved in one or more families. Members of different families have been shown to be prone to appear in clusters, and vice versa. Reconstructed phylogenetic trees and networks may indicate potential evolutionary relationships, which also indicate duplication history in specific related gene clusters and families. Related miRNA families are always found to share common target mRNAs and biological pathways. Some clusters containing non-homologous miRNAs also tend to be clustered together as well as homologous miRNAs. In the present work, it is shown that homologous miRNAs are prone to appear in clusters based on functional and evolutionary pressures. The phenomenon of miRNA clusters containing homologous or genetic relationships is quite common. The integrative evolutionary analysis will provide more potential evolutionary and functional relationships between homologous and clustered miRNAs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The typical analysis always focuses on the annotated canonical miRNAs, although the multiple isomiRs have been reported as potential regulatory molecules with versatile biological roles. Herein, we develop an approach to analyze miRNA at the miRNA/isomiR levels. Firstly, isomiR expression profiles are estimated based on miRNA locus. Secondly, isomiR expression profiles are compared between clustered/homologous miRNAs. Thirdly, isomiR expression profiles are assessed at the isomiR level. Those isomiRs with the same “seed sequences” are classified as a special miRNA class. Finally, isomiR:mRNA interaction is predicted at the isomiR level, and target mRNAs and functional enrichment analysis can be performed to explore biological roles. Furthermore, the approach is applied to analyze miRNA at the miRNA/isomiR levels using small RNA sequencing datasets of tumor and normal cells. The analysis at the miRNA/isomiR levels will track miRNA maturation process and biological genesis, and provide more points to explore versatile biological roles of the small non-coding RNAs.',\n",

One of the major challenges is keeping underlying infrastructure in reasonably low power states and achieving service-level objectives (SLOs) of upper applications as well. Existing solutions, however, cannot effectively tackle this problem for virtualized environments. In this paper, we propose an automated power control solution for such scenarios in hope of making some progress. The major advantage of our solution is being able to precisely control the CPU frequency levels of a physical environment and the CPU power allocations among virtual machines with respect to the SLOs of multiple applications. Based on control theory and online model estimation, our solution can adapt to the variations of application power demands. Additionally, our solution can simultaneously manage the CPU power control for all virtual machines according to their dependencies at either the application-level or the infrastructure-level. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our solution outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in terms of achieving the application SLOs with low infrastructure power consumption.',\n",

However, smaller temporal reconstruction times can not effectively remove motion blur and motion aliasing, while larger times will lead to serious temporal-ringing and the wrong location of a moving object in process of temporal reconstruction. This paper explores how to select an appropriate temporal construction times in the temporal reconstruction. In general, only the number of input video sequences is considered in deciding temporal reconstruction times of video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction. In fact, temporal reconstruction times are also associated with redundant temporal information provided by each input low-temporal resolution video sequence. So, a novel method to select an appropriate temporal reconstruction times is proposed by analyzing the exposure-time and location relation of aligned low resolution input video sequences. From theoretical discussion and experimental results, the proposed method is validated to be effective and efficient.',\n",

Recently, researchers have focused on the immunosuppression induced by rifampicin. Our previous study showed that rifampicin inhibits the production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory mediators and improves neuron survival in inflammation; however, the mechanism through which rifampicin inhibits microglial inflammation and its neuroprotective effects are not completely understood. In this study, we examined the effects of rifampicin on morphological changes induced by LPS in murine microglial BV2 cells. Then we investigated, in BV2 microglia, the effects of rifampicin on two signaling pathway componentss stimulated by LPS, the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In addition, we co-cultured BV2 microglia and neurons to observe the indirect neuroprotective effects of rifampicin. Rifampicin inhibited LPS-stimulated expression of the TLR-4 gene. When neurons were co-cultured with LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia, pre-treatment with rifampicin increased neuronal viability and reduced the number of apoptotic cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that rifampicin, with its anti-inflammatory properties, may be a promising agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

The existing analysis tools for ReaxFF MD lack the capability of capturing chemical reactions directly by analyzing the simulation trajectory, which is critical in exploring reaction mechanisms. This paper presents the algorithms, implementation strategies, features, and applications of VARxMD, a tool for Visualization and Analysis of Reactive Molecular Dynamics. VARxMD is dedicated to detailed chemical reaction analysis and visualization from the trajectories obtained in ReaxFF MD simulations. The interrelationships among the atoms, bonds, fragments, species and reactions are analyzed directly from the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates and bond orders of the atoms in a trajectory, which are accomplished by determination of atomic connectivity for recognizing connected molecular fragments, perception of bond types in the connected fragments for molecules or radicals, indexing of all these molecules or radicals (chemical species) based on their 3D coordinates and recognition of bond breaking or forming in the chemical species for reactions. Consequently, detailed chemical reactions taking place between two sampled frames can be generated automatically. VARxMD is the first tool specialized for reaction analysis and visualization in ReaxFF MD simulations. Applications of VARxMD in ReaxFF MD simulations of coal and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pyrolysis show that VARxMD provides the capabilities in exploring the reaction mechanism in large systems with complex chemical reactions involved that are difficult to access manually. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',\n",

       " '0BotpEwb': {'abstract': 'Email plays a very important role in our daily life. Much work have been put into practice on email network. Those studies mostly require real email network datasets and reliable models to analyze user information and understand the mechanisms of network evolution. However, much research work is constrained by the absence of real large-scale email datasets. Although email communication is ubiquitous, there are very few large-scale available email datasets satisfied different research purposes. Due to privacy policy and restricted permissions, it is arduous to collect a real large-scale email dataset in a short time. Various social network models are usually used to create synthetic email networks. However, these models focus on modeling several structural properties of network without considering user behaviour patterns. They are not appropriate to generate large-scale realistic synthetic email network datasets. Towards this end, we propose a probabilistic model by which we can construct large-scale synthetic email datasets with a small captured email log. What is more important is that the generated synthetic dataset matches real email network properties and individual communication patterns. Moreover, it has linear complexity, and can be paralleled easily. Experimental results on Enron dataset demonstrate the above benefits of our model.',\n",

This paper addresses the stability problem in a dc microgrid with master-slave control structure. Considering the discrete sampling and control algorithm in a digital system, the small-signal models of this dc microgrid have been derived in the z plane. Eigenvalue analysis results show that the system stability and transient response will be affected by the variation of the dc load parameters, the number of slave distributed generations (DGs), and the type of dc load. A centralized oscillation suppression controller, which is composed of a proportional compensator followed by a bandpass filter, is proposed to overcome the unstable oscillations caused by different eigenvalues. The validity of the proposed approach is confirmed by simulations.',\n",

In this paper, based on matrix factorization with co-occurrence neighbor regularization which is derived from context, we propose a novel non-seed model called CONR for SWI.

Although many miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p have been reported as functional miRNAs, fewer miRNA pairs (11 and 6 pairs are collected in tumor and normal cells, respectively) are simultaneously identified as abundant miRNA species.

If both the miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p are abundantly expressed, their isomiR expression profiles are always stable across different samples. Similar to diverse enrichment levels of miR-#-5p and miR-#-3p, the isomiR expression patterns may also be influenced by the phenomenon of \"arm switching\".

The sensor chip consists of two stacked counter-rotating planar aluminium inductors (0.5 μm thick, 100 μm in width, 50 μm space and 6 mm outer diameter) separated by a maskless polyimide film. The two inductors are inductively and capacitively coupled together to form a resonant tank, whose resonant frequency changes with humidity. This topology eliminates the need of a connection bridge or via as used in the usual inductor- capacitor humidity sensors and offers higher sensitivity due to the inner humidity-sensitive parallel-plate capacitor in contrast with the single-layer self-resonant inductor. Three sensor devices with different inductor turns were fabricated and characterised. Measurements show a sensitivity of 45 kHz/%RH with a centre frequency of 50.5 MHz for sensor A (8 turns), 15.8 kHz/%RH, 22 MHz for sensor B (10 turns) and 65 kHz/%RH, 74 MHz for sensor C (4 turns). © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.',\n",

Automata-based multiple string matching algorithms like AC, SBDM and SBOM are widely used in practice, but the huge memory usage of automata prevents them from being applied to a large-scale pattern set.

Here we propose a space-efficient multiple string matching algorithm BVM, which makes use of bit-vector and succinct hash table to replace the automata used in factor-searching-based algorithms.

The relevant literature consists only of case reports, and consequently many of its clinical characteristics and optimal treatment strategies remain unknown. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 23 patients diagnosed with MC of the head and neck between 1991 and 2005. Most patients were treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy. The recurrence, survival and local control rates were evaluated. Results: Thirteen (56.5%) patients were male and 10 were female with a median age of 52 years (range: 15-77 years). The parotid was the most frequently involved site (39.1%). Eighteen patients underwent surgery as their initial treatment and nine of these received postoperative radiotherapy. The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 59% and 31.8%, respectively. The local relapse rate was 30.4% (6/23); eight patients had a distal metastasis, and the lung was the most common site. There was no difference in the local control and survival rates between patients who received surgery alone and those with additional postoperative radiotherapy (. p=0.059). Two patients had partial response after chemotherapy with dacarbazine. Conclusions: The detailed clinical data presented here reveal several new characteristics of MC of the head and neck. Postoperative radiotherapy did not improve the prognosis. Chemotherapeutic regimens that include dacarbazine might be useful.',\n",

       " '3pusC0fv': {'abstract': 'With the motivation of seamlessly extending wireless sensor networks to the external environment, service-oriented architecture comes up as a promising solution. However, as sensor nodes are failure prone, this consequently renders the whole wireless sensor network to seriously faulty. When a particular node is faulty, the service on it should be migrated into those substitute sensor nodes that are in a normal status. Currently, two kinds of approaches exist to identify the substitute sensor nodes: the most common approach is to prepare redundancy nodes, though the involved tasks such as maintaining redundancy nodes, i.e., relocating the new node, lead to an extra burden on the wireless sensor networks. More recently, other approaches without using redundancy nodes are emerging, and they merely select the substitute nodes in a sensor node’s perspective i.e., migrating the service of faulty node to it’s nearest sensor node, though usually neglecting the requirements of the application level. Even a few work consider the need of the application level, they perform at packets granularity and don’t fit well at service granularity. In this paper, we aim to remove these limitations in the wireless sensor network with the service-oriented architecture. Instead of deploying redundancy nodes, the proposed mechanism replaces the faulty sensor node with consideration of the similarity on the application level, as well as on the sensor level. On the application level, we apply the Bloom Filter for its high efficiency and low space costs. While on the sensor level, we design an objective solution via the coefficient of a variation as an evaluation for choosing the substitute on the sensor level.',\n",

       " 'VZ0LwyOT': {'abstract': 'The origin and evolution of new microRNAs (miRNAs) is important because they can impact the transcriptome broadly. As miRNAs can potentially emerge constantly and rapidly, their rates of birth and evolution have been extensively debated. However, most new miRNAs identified appear not to be biologically significant. After an extensive search, we identified 12 new miRNAs that emerged de novo in Drosophila melanogaster in the last 4 million years (Myrs) and have been evolving adaptively. Unexpectedly, even though they are adaptively evolving at birth, more than 94% of such new miRNAs disappear over time. They provide selective advantages, but only for a transient evolutionary period. After 30 Myrs, all surviving miRNAs make the transition from the adaptive phase of rapid evolution to the conservative phase of slow evolution, apparently becoming integrated into the transcriptional network. During this transition, the expression shifts from being tissue-specific, predominantly in testes and larval brain/gonads/imaginal discs, to a broader distribution in many other tissues. Interestingly, a measurable fraction (20-30%) of these conservatively evolving miRNAs experience \"evolutionary rejuvenation\" and begin to evolve rapidly again. These rejuvenated miRNAs then start another cycle of adaptive - conservative evolution. In conclusion, the selective advantages driving evolution of miRNAs are themselves evolving, and sometimes changing direction, which highlights the regulatory roles of miRNAs. © 2014 Lyu et al.',\n",

To improve the dc-bus voltage control dynamics, traditional approaches attempt to measure and feedforward the load or source power in the dc-bus control scheme. However, in a microgrid system with distributed dc sources and loads, the traditional feedforward-based methods need remote measurement with communications. In this paper, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based dc-bus voltage control is proposed, which does not need the remote measurement and enables the important 'plug-and-play' feature. Based on this observer, a novel dc-bus voltage control scheme is developed to suppress the transient fluctuations of dc-bus voltage and improve the power quality in such a microgrid system. Details on the design of the observer, the dc-bus controller and the pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) dead-time compensation are provided in this paper. The effects of possible dc-bus capacitance variation are also considered. The performance of the proposed control strategy has been successfully verified in a 30 kVA hybrid microgrid including ac/dc buses, battery energy storage system, and photovoltaic (PV) power generation system. © 2014 IEEE.\",\n",

After systematical treatment, one case died, the other 6 cases recovered, and no one relapsed or got functional disability during the one-year follow-up. Conclusions: Neurobrucellosis is a rare type of brucellosis, and its clinical manifestations lack of specificity, and imaging and serological detections are important for diagnosis. It is beneficial for patients if diagnosed early and treated systematically, so good understanding of this disease, early diagnosis and treatment are of great value.

       " 'gqCWhmhe': {'abstract': 'Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have important roles in various biological processes. Here, miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression profiles were analyzed in human HepG2 and L02 cells using high-throughput technologies. An integrative method was developed to identify possible functional relationships between different RNA molecules. The dominant deregulated miRNAs were prone to be downregulated in tumor cells, and the most abnormal mRNAs and lncRNAs were always upregulated. However, the genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed RNA species did not show significant bias between up- and downregulated populations. miRNA-mRNA interaction was performed based on their regulatory relationships, and miRNA-lncRNA and mRNA-lncRNA interactions were thoroughly surveyed and identified based on their locational distributions and sequence correlations. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further analyzed based on their multiple isomiRs. IsomiR repertoires and expression patterns were varied across miRNA loci. Several specific miRNA loci showed differences between tumor and normal cells, especially with respect to abnormally expressed miRNA species. These findings suggest that isomiR repertoires and expression patterns might contribute to tumorigenesis through different biological roles. Systematic and integrative analysis of different RNA molecules with potential cross-talk may make great contributions to the unveiling of the complex mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. © 2014 Li Guo et al.',\n",

Our method is built on common visual patterns (CVPs), which are the distinctive visual structures between two images and have rich contextual information. With CVPs, two contextual query expansions on visual word-level and image-level are explored, respectively. For visual word-level expansion, we find contextual synonymous visual words (CSVWs) and expand a word in the query image with its CSVWs to boost retrieval accuracy. CSVWs are the words that appear in the same CVPs and have same contextual meaning, i.e. similar spatial layout and geometric transformations. For image-level expansion, the database images that have the same CVPs are organized by linked list and the images that have the same CVPs as the query image, but not included in the results are automatically expanded. The main computation of these two expansions is carried out offline, and they can be integrated into the inverted file and efficiently applied to all images in the dataset. Experiments conducted on three reference datasets and a dataset of one million images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. © 2014 IEEE.',\n",

       " 'UMjPM24A': {'abstract': 'In this paper, we explore a new research problem of predicting an incoming classifier on dynamic data streams, named as forward classification. The state-of-the-art classification models on data streams, such as the incremental and ensemble models, fall into the retrospective classification category where models used for classification are built from past observed stream data and constantly lag behind the incoming unobserved test data. As a result, the classification model and test data are temporally inconsistent, leading to severe performance deterioration when the concept (joint probability distribution) evolves rapidly. To this end, we propose a new forward classification method which aims to build the classification model which fits the current data. Specifically, forward classification first predicts the incoming classifier based on a line of recent classifiers, and then uses the predicted classifier to classify current data chunk. A learning framework which can adaptively switch between forward classification and retrospective classification is also proposed. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.',\n",

This has prompted the rapid development of jamming-resistance infrastructure consisting of multiple dynamic access points such as proxies, anonymous communication nodes and covert communication nodes. However, the channel between user and access point has become an emerging attacking target for the adversary. Once the channel is detected and identified by the adversary, the channel will be interrupted. Though users can require new access points from the infrastructure and resume the communication to their destination, the service quality will be downgraded dramatically due to the time-consuming bootstrapping process. In this paper, a moving target framework is proposed to improve the network service accessibility, which combines both time-consuming bootstrapping and frequent and low-cost channel refreshing operations. The constant channel refreshing operations is imported to limit the adversary's ability of detecting and blocking communications, thus to make the lifespan of effective communication longer. With theoretical and simulating analysis, the optimized refreshing strategy is proposed, which can help improve service accessibility.\",\n",

Most work exploits the behavioral analysis to distinguish IWA and non- IWA. These approaches are mainly divided into categories: direct compute method and training learning method. The direct calculation method mainly relies on crawler, and makes multidimensional eigenvector to detect IWA. Nevertheless, it did not consider the behavior rules based on the time sequence, and just determine the user behavior by feather vector, so the results are not very accurate. The recognition rate also needs to be improved. The second method mainly relies on cluster approaches. However, cluster approaches require predetermined the number of clustering, which will directly lead to the model over fitting and owe fitting because of inadequate unit number. In this paper we propose a sequential pattern approach based on DPMM for IWA identification. Firstly, we analyze the user behavior of potential IWA and get a feature vector of user behavior. Secondly, we use DPMM to get effective and accurate clustering results. Finally, we use the sequential pattern mining algorithms to detect navy accounts.

It is generally recognized that traffic sharing the same server IP and server port is generated by the same application. In this paper, we say that they are belonging to the same service. Therefore, we propose a novel method, in which service-based statistical features are used for cluster analysis, to classify these elephant traffic. Preliminary results on a real network traffic dataset show that our method is able to automatically identify similar unknown applications. We believe that classifying unknown traffic in service perspective is a promising direction. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).',\n",

       " '1XIQkrwj': {'abstract': 'As a significant milestone in the data dissemination of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the comb-needle (CN) model was developed to dynamically balance the sensor data pushing and pulling during hybrid data dissemination. Unfortunately, the hybrid push-pull data dissemination strategy may overload some sensor nodes and form the hotspots that consume energy significantly. This usually leads to the collapse of the network at a very early stage. In the past decade, although many energy-aware dynamic data dissemination methods have been proposed to alleviate the hotspots issue, the block characteristic of sensor nodes has been overlooked and how to offload traffic from hot blocks with low energy through long-distance hybrid dissemination remains an open problem. In this paper, we developed a block-aware data dissemination model to balance the inter-block energy and eliminate the spreading of intra-block hotspots. Through the clustering mechanism based on geography and energy, \"similar\" large-scale sensor nodes can be efficiently grouped into specific blocks to form the global block information (GBI). Based on GBI, the long-distance block-cross hybrid algorithms are further developed by effectively aggregating inter-block and intra-block data disseminations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

According to the operating characteristics of these distributed generators (DGs), an improved load following (ILF) control strategy is presented to improve the renewable energy penetration and decrease the diesel consumption remarkably, and also to optimize the capacity size and operation conditions of the battery energy storage system (BESS). This ILF strategy uses DE and biomass plant to follow the net load variations at different time scales respectively, and the BESS mainly help to keep the system stabilization. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is adopted to solve the multi-objective optimization model considering the net present cost (NPC) and the pollutant emission level in the 20 years full life cycle.

Many researchers have been studying the objective quality assessment method based on human visual system. Recently, the single-scale feature-similarity index metric has been proposed to provide a good approximation to perceived image quality. However, this metric does not take into account the fact that features in a certain scale cannot reflect various distorted details in the image. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-scale structural image quality assessment based on two-stage low-level features, which supplies more flexible than previous single-scale method by incorporating the variations of viewing conditions and resolution. In this multi-scale framework, different weights are assigned to various scales with different levels of importance. Extensive experiments on the five public benchmark databases indicate that the proposed metric is more consistent with the subjective evaluations than all the other competing methods evaluated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A total of 360 children with a confirmed diagnosis of JIA were enrolled, and their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent a chest X-ray. The patients with PLD were assigned to PLD group, while those without PLD were assigned to non-PLD group. The clinical, imaging, and laboratory results of JIA patients with PLD were analyzed. Results: Among the 360 JIA patients, 43 (11.9%) had PLD, and 9 (21%) of them had respiratory symptoms. Chest X-ray findings mainly included interstitial pneumonitis (53.5%) and pleurisy and/or pleural effusion (38.1%). In the 43 cases of JIA-PLD, 4 (9.3%) had normal chest X-ray findings but abnormal chest CT findings. The incidence of PLD was relatively high in patients aged under 3 years and those aged 12 years or above. Children with systemic JIA had a relatively high incidence of PLD. Compared with the non-PLD group, the PLD group had a significantly higher incidence of anemia, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and IgG levels in peripheral blood, and positive rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies (P< 0.05). Conclusions: Among children with JIA, PLD is mostly seen in patients with systemic JIA or aged <3 years or ≥12 years, especially those with anemia, elevated WBC count and IgG levels, and positive rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies. For JIA patients with PLD, interstitial pneumonitis is usually seen on chest X-ray or CT, but respiratory symptoms are rarely observed.

       " 'Y2EMcZu3': {'abstract': 'Background: DNA-binding proteins are vital for the study of cellular processes. In recent genome engineering studies, the identification of proteins with certain functions has become increasingly important and needs to be performed rapidly and efficiently. In previous years, several approaches have been developed to improve the identification of DNA-binding proteins. However, the currently available resources are insufficient to accurately identify these proteins. Because of this, the previous research has been limited by the relatively unbalanced accuracy rate and the low identification success of the current methods.Results: In this paper, we explored the practicality of modelling DNA binding identification and simultaneously employed an ensemble classifier, and a new predictor (nDNA-Prot) was designed. The presented framework is comprised of two stages: a 188-dimension feature extraction method to obtain the protein structure and an ensemble classifier designated as imDC. Experiments using different datasets showed that our method is more successful than the traditional methods in identifying DNA-binding proteins. The identification was conducted using a feature that selected the minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR). An accuracy rate of 95.80% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.986 were obtained in a cross validation. A test dataset was tested in our method and resulted in an 86% accuracy, versus a 76% using iDNA-Prot and a 68% accuracy using DNA-Prot.Conclusions: Our method can help to accurately identify DNA-binding proteins, and the web server is accessible at http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/~songli/nDNA. In addition, we also predicted possible DNA-binding protein sequences in all of the sequences from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.',\n",

In our study, we reanalyzed an integrated data to promote classification performance by rebuilding miRNA-mRNA modules, in which a group of deregulated miRNAs cooperatively regulated a group of significant mRNAs. In five-fold cross validation, the multiple processes flow considered the biological and statistical significant correlations. First, of statistical significant miRNAs, 6 were identified as core miRNAs. Second, in the 13 significant pathways enriched by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), 705 deregulated mRNAs were found. Based on the union of predicted sets and correlation sets, 6 modules were built. Finally, after verified by test sets, three indexes, including area under the ROC curve (AUC), Accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs), indicated only 4 modules (miR-106b- CIT- KPNA2-miR-93, miR-106b- POLQ-miR-93, miR-107- BTRC- UBR3-miR-16 and miR-200c-miR-16- EIF2B5-miR-15b) had discriminated ability and their classification performance were prior to that of the single molecules. By applying this flow to different subtypes, Module 1 was the consistent module across subtypes, but some different modules were still specific to each subtype.

       " 'aW8aHIop': {'abstract': 'Regular Expression (RegEx) matching, as a core operation in many network and security applications, is typically performed on Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) to process packets at wire speed; however, DFA size is often exponential in the number of RegExes. RegEx grouping is the practical way to address DFA state explosion. Prior RegEx grouping algorithms are extremely slow and memory intensive. In this paper, we first propose DFAestimator, an algorithm that can quickly estimate DFA size for a given RegEx set without building the actual DFA. Second, we propose RegexGrouper, a RegEx grouping algorithm based on DFA size estimation. In terms of speed and memory consumption, our work is orders of magnitude more efficient than prior art because DFA size estimation is much faster and memory efficient than DFA construction. In terms of the resulting size sum of DFAs, our work is significantly more effective than prior art because we use a much finer grained quantification of the degree of interaction between two RegExes. For example, to divide the RegEx set of the L7-filter system into 7 groups, prior art uses 279.3 minutes and the resulting 7 DFAs have a total of 29047 states, whereas RegexGrouper uses 3.2 minutes and the resulting 7 DFAs have a total of 15578 states.',\n",

       " 'UUXzwPur': {'abstract': 'While mature miRNAs have been widely studied, the terminal loop sequences are rarely examined despite regulating both primary and mature miRNA functions. Herein, we attempted to understand the evolutionary pattern of loop sequences by analyzing loops in the let-7 gene family. Compared to the stable miRNA length distributions seen in most metazoans, higher metazoan species exhibit a longer length distribution. Examination of these loop sequence length distributions, in addition to phylogenetic tree construction, implicated loop sequences as the main evolutionary drivers in miRNA genes. Moreover, loops from relevant clustered miRNA gene families showed varying length distributions and higher levels of nucleotide divergence, even between homologous pre-miRNA loops. Furthermore, we found that specific nucleotides were dominantly distributed in the 59 and 39 terminal loop ends, which may contribute to the relatively precise cleavage that leads to a stable isomiR expression profile. Overall, this study provides further insight into miRNA processing and maturation and further enriches our understanding of miRNA biogenesis. Copyright:',\n",

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of RTX therapy in patients with refractory AITP secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren syndrome (SS). Methods Twenty-one SLE and/or SS patients with treatment-resistant AITP were treated once or repeatedly with RTX at the Rheumatology Clinic Renji Hospital, during the period March 2012 to June 2014. Clinical and laboratory variables recorded at every follow-up visit were analyzed. Results The median age of all patients was 37.05 ± 3.15 years (range, 13-67 years; 20 female and 1 male). The median AITP duration before RTX treatment was 5.46 years. Previous treatments of 21 patients included immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids (n = 19), cyclosporine (n = 9), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 2), methotrexate (n = 3), cyclophosphamide (n = 2), vincristine (n = 3), and hydroxychloroquine (n = 15), and 7 patients received concomitantly intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Two patients had undergone splenectomy without improvement. Seventeen patients (80.95%) were treated repeatedly with RTX during the follow-up period. The overall response rate to RTX treatment (including complete response, 52.38%; partial response, 28.57%) was 80.95%. A significant increase (P < 0.05) of platelet counts was seen after 1 month (median, 32.24 × 10<sup>9</sup>/mL vs 66.53 × 10<sup>9</sup>/mL). Relapses occurred mostly during the first 9 months, and maintaining duration of response was 10.27 months (range, 2-17 months) on average after the first RTX infusion. Antiplatelet antibodies, especially IgG isotype, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after RTX treatment. No adverse effects were observed among 15 patients (71.4%); however, 2 cases died of severe pneumonia, and another developed lymphoma. Conclusions Rituximab is an additional potent therapeutic treatment option for SLE and SS patients with AITP refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. For most patients, RTX was safe and well tolerated.',\n",

There are usually two main dimension reduction strategies, feature extraction and feature selection. Feature extraction is to create new features to represent documents, whereas feature selection will return a subset of words as features. Comparing two strategies, feature extraction has powerful capacity in reducing dimensionality, but it will lost intuitive semantic for documents. Feature selection has perfect interpretability for text contents, and specially is significant for text dimension reduction, but it is still a difficult work to design a suitable measure for feature evaluation. In this paper we present a new feature selection method called class subspace feature selection (CSFS) method. We utilize PCA feature extraction method to capture lower dimensional class subspaces, and then base on the subspaces to choose the most relevant features to the subspaces. The feature words chosen by our method can approximate the class subspace which has lower dimensionality and also owns intuitive semantic understanding for the class.

For the sake of the whole postoperative spherical aberration were close to 0.1μm, 9 cases (16 eyes) with corneal spherical aberration <0.15μm were implanted Sofport Advanced Optic IOL, named AO group; 45 cases (57 eyes) with corneal spherical aberration 0.25~0.3μm were implanted AcrySof IQ IOL, named IQ group; 19 cases (27 eyes) with corneal spherical aberration >0.35μm were implanted Tecnis ZA9003 IOL, named Tecnis group. Aspherical IOL was implanted after phacoemulsification through a cornea 2.75mm incision without suture. Uncorrected visual acuity, beat corrected visual acuity, spherical aberration of the whole eye and jnternal optics (mainly IOL) at 6mm pupil diameter were examined at 3mo postoperatively.

       " 'xSwUQG2C': {'abstract': 'Various binary features have been recently proposed in literature, aiming at improving the computational efficiency and storage efficiency of image retrieval applications. However, the most common way of using binary features is voting strategy based on brute-force matching, since binary features are discrete data points distributed in Hamming space, so that models based on clustering such as BoW are unsuitable for them. Although indexing mechanism substantially decreases the time cost, the brute-force matching strategy becomes a bottleneck that restricts the performance of binary features. To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective method, namely COIP (Coding by Order-independent Projection), which projects binary features into a binary code of limited bits. As a result, each image is represented by one single binary code that can be indexed for computational and storage efficiency. We prove that the similarity between the COIP codes of two images with probability proportional to the ratio of their matched features. A comprehensive evaluation with several state-of-the-art binary features is performed on benchmark dataset. Experimental results reveal that for binary feature based image retrieval, our approach improves the storage/time efficiency by one/two orders of magnitude, while the retrieval performance remains almost unchanged.',\n",

So, this paper proposes a method pTrace to defeat the DDoS attack sources in cloud, which comprising the packet filter module inFilter and the malicious process retroactive module mpTrace. inFilter mainly filters packets with forged source address. And, mpTrace firstly identifies attack streams and their corresponding source addresses, then trace malicious processes based on the obtained source addresses. We have implemented a prototype system under Openstack and Xen environment. Experimental results and analysis show that inFilter can prevent large-scale DDoS attack frombeing launched in cloud center with lower time consumption, and mpTrace can identify a attack flow correctly when its flow rate is about 2.5 times the normal traffic, tracing malicious processes in ms time level.

Thus, it is imperative to combine both text and link data to complement and correct mining results. However, previous work did not explore a uniform generative model that can unveil their inner relationship probably because of the difficulty to harness the heterogenous data in social networks. To address this issue, in this paper we present a generative model Topic Block that clearly pinpoints the latent concept underlying the text corpus and link network, i.e., User inner interests. In our generative model, user inner interests guide the generation of the topic and community distributions underlying the text corpus and link data.

We study the Weighted Rate Balance problem with the constraint of the transmit power of the cognitive network. Joint beamforming at the cognitive base station and the relay station is used to maximize the Weighted Rate Balance of SUs. To solve the non-convex problem, we adopt the classic altering optimization method, namely the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.

Fick's law is adopted to analyze the simulated results, which clarifies the effect degrees of constrictivity and tortuosity on chloride diffusivity. The results show that ions distribution in pore fluid is affected by bound chlorides in nanochannel walls, leading to formation of positron layers which adsorb free chlorides and reduce their diffusion rate.

Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task. We empirically evaluate SSE in two benchmark tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-The-Art methods. Furthermore, SSE is a general framework. The smoothness assumption can be imposed to a wide variety of embedding models, and it can also be constructed using other information besides entities' semantic categories.\",\n",

However, this method does not make the best use of the turbines aerodynamic characteristics to optimize the operation conditions in middle and low wind speed. Based on analysis of the full-range WPCC operational characteristics, a novel WPCC (N-WPCC) strategy had been proposed through the combination of active turbine speed control and pitch regulation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, through giving priority to the torque control than the pitch regulation compared with the traditional WPCC, N-WPCC can effectively decrease the frequency and amplitude of the pitch actor, thus to extend its operating life, and can also improve the power generation to some extent because of taking the full advantage of the turbines vast rotational inertia.

       " '09BsvVfS': {'abstract': 'Ensemble learning is a common tool for data stream classification, mainly because of its inherent advantages of handling large volumes of stream data and concept drifting. Previous studies, to date, have been primarily focused on building accurate ensemble models from stream data. However, a linear scan of a large number of base classifiers in the ensemble during prediction incurs significant costs in response time, preventing ensemble learning from being practical for many real-world time-critical data stream applications, such as Web traffic stream monitoring, spam detection, and intrusion detection. In these applications, data streams usually arrive at a speed of GB/second, and it is necessary to classify each stream record in a timely manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel Ensemble-tree (E-tree for short) indexing structure to organize all base classifiers in an ensemble for fast prediction. On one hand, E-trees treat ensembles as spatial databases and employ an R-tree like height-balanced structure to reduce the expected prediction time from linear to sub-linear complexity. On the other hand, E-trees can be automatically updated by continuously integrating new classifiers and discarding outdated ones, well adapting to new trends and patterns underneath data streams. Theoretical analysis and empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach.',\n",

Here, we applied a comparative proteomic strategy, based on 2D and MALDI-TOF/MS platforms, to examine the differential expression of proteins in MDBK cells that were treated and not treated with virulent IBRV LN01/08 and attenuated IBRV LNM strains. A total of eight differential proteins, including pyruvate kinase, heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1), annexin A, albumin (ALB), scinderin (SCIN), tubulin (alpha 1a) and vimentin (VIM), were identified. Among these proteins, pyruvate kinase, and HSP90 (HSP90AB1), tubulin and vimentin were identified in the virulent IBRV LN01/08 strain group, but were not identified in the attenuated IBRV LNM group. These results play an important role in tumor formation and development, cell migration, tumor cell line apoptosis, cell invasion and viral infection. The HSP90 (HSP90AA1) protein was identified in the control group and the attenuated IBRV LNM-infected group. Most studies have shown that HSP90 proteins were more of a cancer gene target, and inhibiting its function would result to oncogene degradation during cancer treatment. On the other hand, ALB is associated to cell differentiation, apoptosis, necrosis, cell death, viral infection, autophagy, interstitial tissue inflammation, and cell survival. These results provide a theoretical basis for the systematic understanding of BHV-1-infection mechanisms and BHV-1-induced immune responses.',\n",

However, our understanding of the role of ApoE in Wilson's disease is limited. High copper concentration in Wilson's disease induces excessive generation of free oxygen radicals. Meanwhile, ApoE proteins possess antioxidant effects. We therefore determined whether copper-induced oxidative damage differ in the liver of wild-type and ApoE knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Both wild-type and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were intragastrically administered with 0.2 mL of copper sulfate pentahydrate (200 mg/kg; a total dose of 4 mg/d) or the same volume of saline daily for 12 weeks, respectively. Copper and oxidative stress markers in the liver tissue and in the serum were assessed. Our results showed that, compared with the wild-type mice administered with copper, TBARS as a marker of lipid peroxidation, the expression of oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, and quinone 1 (NQO1) significantly increased in the ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice administered with copper, meanwhile superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly decreased.

A specific application of spectrum leasing is designed to ensure the secrecy performance of the whole network, in which the SUs access the spectrum in reward of helping improve the secrecy performance of the entire CRN. The transmit signals of the secondary network are designed to ensure the secrecy rate performance of both the primary and the secondary networks. To make it solvable with a method based on parameterizing the power gain region, the secrecy rate balancing problem is relaxed. The relaxation is further proved to be tight and the relaxed problem is equivalent to the original problem. Finally, we use a two-dimensional search to achieve the optimal transmit beamformer.

In this paper, we establish new upper bounds to significantly reduce the number of Monte-Carlo simulations in greedy-based algorithms, especially at the initial step. We theoretically prove that the bound is tight and convergent when the summation of weights towards (or from) each node is less than 1. Based on the bound, we propose a new Upper Bound based Lazy Forward algorithm ( UBLF in short) for discovering the top-k influential nodes in social networks. We test and compare UBLF with prior greedy algorithms, especially CELF [30].

The optimal error estimates of the semi-discrete scheme can be obtained for the linear case. Some numerical experiments in multi-dimensional spaces are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of this scheme.',\n",

The interface of the bilayer system between MS and PE layer is assumed to be imperfectly connected and is modeled by the shear-lag model. A sixth-order differential equation governing the displacement is derived and its analytical solution is derived. The effect of interfacial property on the static and dynamic ME behaviors includes the average output electrical power density of vibration-based ME bilayer system is discussed. The present analytic results can be degenerated to the ones for a bilayer system with perfect interfaces. It can be found that the interfacial properties play a critical role in the performance characteristics of the ME bilayer system. A quite different feature from previous work is that the static ME effect founded to be length size-dependent. The potential applications of this theoretical analysis can be found in evaluating the performance of the MS-PE composite with imperfectly interface.',\n",

       " 'T9k9gyAa': {'abstract': 'The cutterhead endures strong, multi-point distributed impact loads when the full face rock tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnels, which leads to intense vibration and fatigue fracture. Accordingly the structure should meet the requirement of service life considering the fracture failure at weak locations. Hence, cutterhead damage mechanism is crucial to predict and analyze residual life of a operational cutterhead under impact loads. This paper combines with the characteristics of cutterhead life, Paris model and damage cumulative theory, proposes a new failure criterion for the long thick plate in complex stress states, and establishes a segmented crack propagation life prediction model, based on the existing multi-degree-of-freedom coupling dynamic TBM cutterhead model and fatigue crack propagation prediction method for large and complex structures. Meanwhile, a physical fatigue damage test of cutterhead specimens is carried out to validate the theoretical model. Then a TBM cutterhead in a water tunnel project is taken as an example, to calculate the fatigue crack propagation and analyze how different parameters affect fatigue life. The results of the analyses reveal that with fatigue crack propagation, life of actual cutterhead is 36.5. km, which gives a meaningful reference for cutterhead design. In addition, the cutterhead life decreases nearly 45.2% with the initial crack depth increasing from 0.5. mm to 2. mm, and it is inferred that the value of initial crack depth should be controlled below 1.6. mm, to ensure the service life. On the other side, the larger the crack shape ratio (a/c), the longer the fatigue life, and the cutterhead life with a round crack (a/c= 1) is about 3 times with a narrow crack (a/c= 0.1). Furthermore, the crack growth rate parameter m has greater influence on cutterhead life than parameter C, with C increasing 10%, the life decreases about 9%; however, the life decreases nearly 13% when m increases 1%. Then, the critical threshold values of cutterhead material parameters to meet life requirement are obtained. From the results of fatigue damage test, it can be showed that the specimens fracture quickly when the crack depth exceeds 50% of the panel thickness, and the crack shape ratio gradually increases with the loading cycles, which is consistent with the theoretical assumption, as well as the influence rules of parameters.',\n",

Methods: We treated a series of 18 patients (34 eyes) with genetic ectopia lentis whose visual acuity did not improve with optical phakic or aphakic correction, or with modern microsurgery and automated suction- cutting devices. Laser interferometry and electroretinogram (ERG) were used for the examination of retinal function before surgery. Results: There was not significant difference between the interferometric acuity before operation and the corrected visual acuity after operation (p>0.05), and the coincidence rate between them was 80% (27 eyes). ERG examination showed normal function in most of the patients. Conclusions: The results showed that the laser interferometric acuity is a valuable method in evaluation of postoperative visual acuity in patients with ectopia lentis. In six eyes, the LIVA was lower than the initial corrected vision postoperatively, but ERG examination showed that the retinal function was normal in these patients. Therefore, in patients with genetic ectopia lentis, LIVA combined with ERG predicts visual acuity more accurately.',\n",

       " 'n6LzIFhS': {'abstract': \"The overall goal of this article is to address the shortcomings of the current literature by providing a systematic estimate of the volume of labour flow, describing the composition of the labour force and analysing the determinants of labour flow. Having a better picture of China's labour movements may help leaders to understand how many people participate in China's trans-regional labour market, who benefits, and which factors encourage some to enter and prevent others from leaving home. This information should facilitate better policy-making. The article uses a theoretical framework to analyse the determinants of migration systematically, to formulate predictions of which factors affect labour movement and to test competing hypotheses raised in the literature. In this article we seek to answer several questions about the contribution of four factors to migration: the income level of those who choose to migrate, chain migration, rural institutions and human capital. First, are the poor and those without local wage-earning opportunities more likely to migrate, or the rich and those with skills valuable in the city? Secondly, is chain migration important? If so, what are the key elements that make it important? Do information and the social network that conveys that information matter most, or are transportation costs and proximity to urban regions vital? Thirdly, do rural institutions prevent people from leaving the village, push people off the farm, or are they neutral, perhaps weakened by the rise of markets? Finally, does human capital, in particular education, facilitate entrance into the migrant labour force? Or is education inconsequential? Drawing on our own extensive survey of 200 villages, we estimate that 154 million people from rural areas of China worked off-farm in 1995, including 54 million long-term migrants and over 15 million self-employed who have left their villages. Some of our major findings are that rural migration has created one of the main opportunities for women to enter the off-farm labour force and that rural migrants are moving progressively further away from home. Our analysis also demonstrates that being part of a network of labourers (or being involved in chain migration) is key to facilitating labour movement out of a village. Transportation and rural institutional barriers are not formidable obstacles to migration. The following section introduces our data. The next three sections offer descriptive evidence of labour movements in China's rural villages and present an analytical framework for explaining migration. The sixth section raises a number of hypotheses suggested by the descriptive data and previous studies, and the final sections present our results and offer conclusions.\",\n",

       " 'XwdyiM5A': {'abstract': 'A carbonate crust, with a principally digitate structure, caps latest Permian reef complexes in east Sichuan, China. The crust contains the conodont Hinedodus parvus, confirming its age as earliest Triassic; it therefore closely postdates the end-Permian mass extinction, and is related to associated palaeoenvironmental change. Although its branches have lobate margins, and internal structures of radial fabrics and lobate fabrics in different specimens, an organic origin cannot be confirmed, because crust fabric is largely recrystallised. Therefore we apply the term ?microbialite to reflect uncertainty of its nature. The crust is co-eval (within the parvus Zone) with confirmed microbial biostromes and mounds in Guizhou Province, south of Sichuan. The sum of evidence, assembled by workers in several sites worldwide, indicates a sea-level rise occurred in the boundary interval, and this is corroborated by facies of the Sichuan crust. Abrupt appearance and disappearance of the crust, formed by precipitated carbonates, in east Sichuan, represents short-lived unusual post-extinction marine conditions which were switched abruptly on, then off. Microbial deposits overlying the P/T boundary in other locations in the Tethys Ocean (Iran and Japan) support the view that the unusual oceanic conditions had at least a regional distribution. Because the crust abruptly terminates, and is not succeeded by fossil-rich deposits, application of the disaster biota concept is inappropriate; an environmentally-driven control on carbonate precipitation is better supported by the evidence, whether or not it was biotically-mediated.',\n",

The margins of Wenlock patch reefs tend to have diffuse edges that grade into the surrounding bedded facies because of talus shed from the reefs. However, portions of patch reefs show sharp-bounded reef margins, with bedded limestones terminating abruptly against the reef edge, Examples of sharp boundaries where the reef comprises only carbonate mudstone-wackestone with poorly-defined gross fabric, and containing no metazoan framework, have been found in Wenlock patch reefs the UK and Gotland. Although in some cases the micrite may demonstrate a peloidal structure, in others there is no clear structure, broadly fitting the aphanitic (structureless) type of fabric found in leiolites (suspected microbial facies that show no structure). The fabrics are interpreted to have been formed by microbial mediation of micrite precipitation as part of reef construction, and are therefore automicrites. In all cases the sharp reef edges indicate coherence of the micritic fabric, interpreted as a lithified wall against which bedded limestones were deposited. This arrangement supports published interpretations of pronounced topography of Wenlock patch reefs, and shows the presence of steep, vertical and, possibly, overhanging reef margins, formed prior to bedded sediment accumulation. Thus, there is likely to have been a time interval between reef formation and deposition of bedded sediments, possibly caused by reef upward growth in transgressive settings, followed by catch-up of bedded limestone deposition. © The Geological Society of London.',\n",

ETMs are distinguished from rarer, and more regional, subsequent Triassic microbialites. Large differences in ETMs between northern and southern areas of the South China block suggest geographic provinces, and ETMs are most abundant throughout the equatorial Tethys Ocean with further geographic variation. ETMs occur in shallow-marine shelves in a superanoxic stratified ocean and form the only widespread Phanerozoic microbialites with structures similar to those of the Cambro-Ordovician, and briefly after the latest Ordovician, Late Silurian and Late Devonian extinctions. ETMs disappeared long before the mid-Triassic biotic recovery, but it is not clear why, if they are interpreted as disaster taxa. In general, ETM occurrence suggests that microbially mediated calcification occurred where upwelled carbonate-rich anoxic waters mixed with warm aerated surface waters, forming regional dysoxia, so that extreme carbonate supersaturation and dysoxic conditions were both required for their growth. Long-term oceanic and atmospheric changes may have contributed to a trigger for ETM formation. In equatorial western Pangea, the earliest microbialites are late Early Triassic, but it is possible that ETMs could exist in western Pangea, if well-preserved earliest Triassic facies are discovered in future work. © Springer-Verlag 2007.',\n",

Morphologic changes were examined by microscopy and fluorescence microscope. The expression of IEGs was detected through immunohistochemistry method. Results. After 30min of ischemia, the spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) reduced rapidly by 85.3%. The SCBF increased immediately at the moment of reperfusion onset and reached the peak value after 10 min of reperfusion. The SCBF approximately recovered the baseline level after 30min of reperfusion and the decreased gradually. Some rats appeared the symptom of secondary paralysis after ischemical reperfusion. Under the fluorescence microscope, the morphological changes of apoptosis appeared in spinal cord nerve cells after ischemia and reperfusion, including nucleus pyknosis, aggregate at the edge of nucleus karyotheca and so on.

       " 'eNu10VUE': {'abstract': 'Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate not only into interstitial cells but also into parenchyma cell(e. g. myocardial cells) It is a hotspot of national and international researches to directionally induce MSCs to differentiate into neurocyte in vitro, which has an important theoretical significance. Objective: To investigate the ability of MSCs to differentiate into neuron in vitro in rat. Design: A randomly blank-control study. Setting, Materials and Interventions: Research was completed at Toxicology Department of Public Health School of Jilin University. Six-week old Wistar rats of either gender obtained from experimental animal center of Jilin University were employed. The 2nd to 4th generation of rMSCs were inoculated on 24-well plates covered by microscopic coverglass. There were 3 experiment groups and one control group. Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) with a concentration of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mmol/L was added respectively into 3 experiment group to induce rMSCs generation. Morphologic observation was operated after cellular differentiation. There was no inductive agent added into control group. Cellular identification was operated by immunocytochemistry. Main Outcome Measures: The growth of cultured MSCs; cellular morphologic changes after induction; the immunocytochemical assay of nestin (mouse antirat, monoclone), neuron-specific enolase(NSE) antibody(rabbit anti mouse, mutil-antibodies), and microtubule-associated protein-2a, b (MAP-2a, b). Results: After being added with IBMX, there was little neuron-like cells differentiation in 0.25 mmol/L group; cells in 0.1 mmol/L group gradually died since the 2nd day; neuron-like cells could be seen on the 2nd day in 0.5 mmol/L group with typical morphological characteristics. 0.5 mmol/L IBMX had a best inductive effectiveness. Neuron-like cells could be seen on the 2nd day and on the 6th day, neuron-like cells were with (23.2 ± 2.3) % of the total cells, NSE dye reaction was positive. Non-differentiating cellular expression was nestin. With 3-day induction, positive cells increased, and decreased on the 6th day. Conclusion: rMSC can be amplified, generated in vitro and to be induced into early phase neuron-like cells.',\n",

Methods: MSCs were obtained from rat bone marrow, cultured and passaged. MSCs used in this experiment had multipotency, which was indirectly proved by being induced to differentiate into chondrocytes and adipocytes. MSCs were cultured in medium containing 0.5 mmol/L IBMX for 2 days. Then the medium was replaced with induction medium, which contained GDNF, IL-1β, mesencephalic glial-cell-conditioned medium and flash-frozen mesencephalic membrane fragments. The surface markers of the differentiated neurons, such as NSE, nestin, MAP-2a, b and TH were detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blot after MSCs were cultured in induction medium for 7 days and 15 days. Results: MSCs differentiated into neural progenitors and expressed nestin after MSCs were incubated with medium containing IBMX for 2 d. After the medium was replaced with induction medium containing many inducing agents, MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells and dopaminergic neuron-like cells and expressed NSE, MAP-2a, b and TH. The percentage of NSE-positive cells, MAP-2a, b-positive cells and TH-positive cells was 30.032±2.489%, 41.580±5.101% and 34.958±5.534%, respectively after MSCs were induced in medium containing GDNF, IL-1β, mesencephalic glial-cell-conditioned medium and flash-frozen mesencephalic membrane fragments for 15 days. Conclusion: MSCs can differentiate into dopaminergic neuron-like cells and are a new cell source for the treatment of neurodegeneration diseases and have a great potential for wide application.

       " 'PGsqnDlo': {'abstract': 'Objective: To study the capability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in promoting the recovery of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and provide a new method for the treatment of renal diseases. Methods: BMSCs were cultivated and amplified in vitro from bone marrow cell suspension of healthy 3-week-old C57BL/6J mice. 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into sham operation group (n = 16), parallel control group (n = 16) and cell transplantation group (n = 16). The renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model was established. BMSCs were transplanted into the mice in cell transplantation group via the tail vein and saline was injected into the mice in parallel control group. Renal function, such as the level of serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), the indexes of renal oxidative stress, such as the levels of hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion, morphologic changes and renal pathological changes were detected. Results: Circled digit one BMSCs not only had a high purification, homogeneity and stability, but also had unlimited proliferation. Circle digit two The mice in parallel control group appeared the poor state. The indexes of renal function and oxidative stress were obviously increased. And there were collapse of renal glomerulus, disappearance of renal tubule and infiltration of inflammatory cells in renal tissue. Transplanted mice appeared the good state. The indexes of renal function and indexes of oxidative stress had been significantly improved (P<0.05). The renal pathological changes were not obvious. Conclusion: BMSCs are easily isolated and cultivated in vitro. BMSCs can improve renal ischemia-reperfusion injury via vein transplantation by inhibiting the production and attacking of oxygen free radicals.',\n",

Moreover, the lens imaging functions 'JLU' and '' (English and Chinese abbreviations for Jilin University) were also demonstrated. In order to further enhance the diffraction efficiency, four-level and eight-level FZPs were designed using theoretical calculation and rapidly realized by point-to-point femtosecond laser scanning. In this way, the diffractive efficiency was enhanced from 35.8% for the two-level phase lens to 67% for the four-level phase lens and 73.9% for the eight-level phase lens, which are the largest values reported so far. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization shows that surface height of the micropatterns was lower than the rest of the film due to the loss of oxygen confirmed by XPS and XRD techniques. The electric resistivity and conductivity of as-reduced graphene have strong dependences on output power of femtosecond laser. Moreover, current-voltage curves of graphene microcircuits show typical linear relationship, indicating the stable conductivities. The micro-nanoprocessing of graphene through femtosecond laser technologies might open the door for applications of graphene-based materials in electronic microdevices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The study indicates that at pH 4.0 Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by methimazole and in situ formed Fe(II) reacts with potassium ferricyanide to give soluble Prussian Blue which is characterized by means of XRD analysis. The absorbance of Prussian Blue is measured at the absorption maximum of 735 nm, and the amount of methimazole can be determined based on this absorbance. Beer's law is obeyed in the range of methimazole concentrations of 0.02-6.00 μg/mL. The equation of the linear regression is A = -0.0058 + 0.49988c (μg/mL), with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998 and RSD of 0.80%. The detection limit (3σ/k) is 0.015 μg/mL, and the apparent molar absorption coefficient of indirect determination of methimazole is 5.7 ± 10\",\n",

       " '0hOH0IH0': {'abstract': 'The pig is the non-primate species that is immunologically closest to humans, and has been considered as an alternative source to human allografts for transplantation. In fact, there has been recent interest in identifying and culturing porcine neural progenitor cells (PNPCs) in vitro, but the long-term culturing has not yet been characterized. Here, we reported the spontaneous differentiation of PNPCs into neuronal and glial cells. For in vitro cultures, the primary cells of the subventricular zone of the forebrain striatum were cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor to allow the growth of spherical masses that exhibit sustained growth and self-renewal capacity. After growth factor removal, the neurospheres with 10 and 130 days of culture spontaneously differentiated into Tuj1-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes as seen by double immunocytofluorescence. Molecular characterization using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that neurospheres expressed nestin, neuron-specific enolase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In addition, after cultured in the differentiation medium for 3 months, the growth of neurosphere became slow and displayed cystic structures with the same morphology as that of embryonic bodies derived from embryonic stem cells. It is concluded that PNPCs have the ability to provide an expandable source of neural cells that can develop into neuronal and glial subtypes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.',\n",

When femtosecond laser pulses were used to reduce and pattern GO, oxygen contents in the reduced region could be modulated by varying the laser power. In this way, the bandgap of reduced GO was precisely modulated from 2.4 to 0.9 eV by tuning the femtosecond laser power from 0 to 23 mW. Through the first-principle study, the essence of GO bandgap tailoring is proved to be femtosecond laser reduction induced oxygen-content modulation. As representative illustrations, bottom-gate graphene FETs were fabricated in situ by using femtosecond laser reduced GO as the channel material, and an optimized room temperature on-off ratio of 56 is obtained. The controlled reduction of GO by femtosecond laser contributes great potential for bandgap tailoring and microdevices patterning of graphene toward future electronics. © 2012 American Chemical Society.',\n",

Hierarchical graphene nanostructures were formed after laser interference treatment of graphene oxide, which holds great promise for gaseous molecular adsorption, and thereby significantly increases their sensing performance. By tuning the laser power, the content of oxygen functional groups, could be changed within a certain range, which contributes not only controllable conductivity but also tunable response/recovery time of the humidity sensor due to the interaction between water molecules and oxygen functional groups on the graphene oxide sheets. The laser interference processing of graphene oxide films is a mask-free, surfactant-free and large-area approach to the production of hierarchical graphene micro-nanostructures, and thus shows great potential for fabrication of future graphene-based microdevices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

       " 'tkKmF4dp': {'abstract': \"Cold stress is generally considered to suppress the immune system and may lead to an increase in the occurrence of disease in the presence of a pathogen. The immune system is ordinarily brought back to a baseline response level after immune challenge through homeostatic processes in part regulated by the cytokines. Often, findings reported from various studies investigating the effects of stress on the cytokines are conflicting. This is due to some conditions has limited the accumulation of information on effects of cold stress on cytokine profile. The present study investigated the effects of multiple cytokines in response to a given stressor to understand the role of cytokines in the immunological responses to different duration of cold stress exposure in rats. Thus, researchers simulated animals' hypothermia life environment, using Luminex xMAP and evaluated the effect of cold stress for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 [3,IL-6 and TNF-a), chemokine interferon-y-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Thl (IL-2 and IFJST-y) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) type of cytokine in serum of SPF Wistar rats. Irrespective of the duration, cold stress enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Acute cold stress up-regulated TNT-a, IP-10, IL-2 and IL-4 levels. TNF-a, IL-2 and IL-4 levels showed down-regulate trends compared with the acute cold stress treatment groups in the duration of chronic cold stress. BothlFN-y and IP-10 levels increased significantly in cold stress 9 and 12 days. These data demonstrate that cold stress enhances pro-inflammatory cytokines profile and alterations of Thl and Th2 type cytokines secretion in serum of rats. With the extension of the cold stress time, the cellular adaptive immune response and to some extent, the nonspecific humoral immune response was also affected. © 2012 Medwell Journals.\",\n",

       " 'RwVOAvHD': {'abstract': \"Zi geese (Anser anser domestica) belong to the white geese and are excellent layers with a superior feed-to-egg conversion ratio. Quantitative gene expression analysis, such as Real-time qRT-PCR, will provide a good understanding of ovarian function during egg-laying and consequently improve egg production. However, we still don't know what reference genes in geese, which show stable expression, should be used for such quantitative analysis. In order to reveal such reference genes, the stability of seven genes were tested in five tissues of Zi geese. Methodology/Principal Findings: The relative transcription levels of genes encoding hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), β-actin (ACTB), β-tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate- dehydrogenase (GADPH), succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein (SDH), 28S rRNA (28S) and 18S rRNA (18S) have been quantified in heart, liver, kidney, muscle and ovary in Zi geese respectively at different developmental stages (1 d, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months). The expression stability of these genes was analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software. Conclusions: The expression of 28S in heart, GAPDH in liver and ovary, ACTB in kidney and HPRT1 in muscle are the most stable genes as identified by the three different analysis methods. Thus, these genes are recommended for use as candidate reference genes to compare mRNA transcription in various developmental stages of geese.

       " 'ABlaJwV8': {'abstract': 'In view of mass-production and solution-processing capabilities, graphene oxides (GOs), generally prepared by chemical oxidation of graphite and subsequent exfoliation in aqueous solution, are widely used as an effective route to graphene-like materials. However, the oxygen-containing groups (OCGs) on the graphene sheets make GO insulating, which significantly restricts its applications, especially for electronics. Therefore, reduction methods that are used to remove OCGs become critical. In recent years, in addition to thermal and chemical reduction, photoreduction has emerged as an appealing alternative because photoreduction does not rely on either high temperature or toxic chemicals. In this progress report, the recent development of the photoreduction of GOs and their unique properties are highlighted, as well as their related applications. Photoreduction strategies including photothermal reduction, catalytic/catalyst-free photochemical reduction, and solid state/in-solution laser reduction are summarized. Moreover, photoreduction of GO permits exquisite control over film conductivities, residual oxygen contents, porosity, and surface wettability, which lead to various functionalities towards a wide range of applications, such as field-effect-transistors (FETs), flexible electrodes, sensors, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, photovoltaic devices, and photocatalysis. It is anticipated that, with the rapid progress of photoreduction methodology, GOs would be more competitive in the graphene-oriented applications. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Experimental results showed that the friction coefficient of the pine needle fiber reinforced friction composites was very stable and markedly fade was not obvious compared with specimen FC0 (containing 0 wt% pine needle fibers); the wear rates of the friction composites generally increased with the increase of temperature and were significantly influenced by the test temperature. The wear rate of specimen FC7 (containing 7 wt% of pine needle fibres) was the lowest compared with that of other specimens at each temperature, except for that when the temperatures were about 200 °C. Morphologies of wear surfaces of pine needle fiber reinforced friction composites were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the friction characteristics were analyzed. The results showed that the worn surface of specimen FC7 was smoother compared with that of specimen FC0. © the Partner Organisations 2014.',\n",

Based on previous study of existing friction material problems, hybrid biological fiber-reinforced resin-based friction materials (HBRMs, from the reinforced fiber component of resin-based friction materials) were explored in this study. Bamboo fiber, jute fiber and wool fiber (all have length of 3-5 mm) were processed to make three types of HBRMs and considered as three factors of biological reinforced fiber in test using orthogonal experimental design. Each factor had three levels of 1%, 2% and 3% fiber mass fraction while the ratio of other raw materials remains unchanged. According to the orthogonal experimental design table, nine formulations (denoted as M1-M9) were determined to test the HBRMs. For comparison, non-bio-fiber reinforced friction material (NBM) was added in the test. The properties of the HBRMs tested included Rockwell hardness, impact strength and density. The friction and wear performance of the braking materials was examined by a speed friction tester. The results show that the friction coefficient of the HBRMs was slightly higher than that of the NBM, indicating biological fibers affected the friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of the HBRMs decreased firstly with the increase of temperature and had the lowest value when the temperature reached 300°C, and it increased then as temperature increased. During recovery process, the friction coefficient of the HBRMs firstly increased with the decrease of temperature and then decreased greatly when the temperature dropped to 100°C. The wear rates of the HBRMs increased with the increase of temperature and reached maximum value when temperature reached 200°C, then it decreased with the increase of temperature. The results of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation analysis on the friction coefficient and wear rate show that the best comprehensive properties were presented when the mass fraction of bamboo, jute and wool fiber were 3%, 3% and 1%, respectively. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.',\n",

In order to evaluate the effect of ENO1 on follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) mRNA of primary granular cell from goose F1 follicles, the recombinant plasmid adenovirus carrying ENO1 were constructed and infected the primary culture granular cells. The granular cells were randomly divided into three groups: recombinant adenovirus infected (pAd-CMV-ENO1), empty vector infected (pAd-CMV-Null) and no virus (mock control). The expression levels of FSHR mRNA and LHR mRNA of granular cells were examined by qRT-PCR. The results showed the group pAd-CMV-ENO1 had significantly higher FSHR mRNA expression levels than the other two groups (P < 0.05), but had significantly lower LHR mRNA expression levels than the other two groups (P < 0.05).

Although bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are known to protect against spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury through anti-apoptotic effects, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were cultured and proliferated, then transplanted into rats with ischemia/reperfusion injury via retro-orbital injection. Immunohistochemistry and immunofuorescence with subsequent quantifcation revealed that the expression of the axonal regeneration marker, growth associated protein-43, and the neuronal marker, microtubule-as-sociated protein 2, significantly increased in rats with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation compared with those in rats with spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury. Furthermore, the expression of the autophagy marker, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B, and Beclin 1, was significantly reduced in rats with the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation compared with those in rats with spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of growth associated protein-43 and neuro-flament-H increased but light chain 3B and Beclin 1 decreased in rats with the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. Our results therefore suggest that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation promotes neurite growth and regeneration and prevents autophagy. These responses may likely be mechanisms underlying the protective effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells against spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury.',\n",

The mice were administrated with zinc sulfate once a day for two weeks, subsequently the RIRI animal models were prepared by ligation of the left renal pedicle 30 minutes. 24h after reperfusion, the kidney tissue was removed and pathological results by HE staining showed that in the model group, kidney surface covered with a large number of red exudates, renal tubular dilatated, disorganized, renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolar degenerated, nuclear pyknosis and necrosis appeared; congestive and necrosis were visible in medullary junction. The pathological changes of renal ischemia- reperfusion were obviously relieved in the animals with medium and low-dose zinc pretreatment. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the lowdose zinc sulfate pretreatment group was significantly higher than that in the model and high-dose groups (P <0.05). The malondialdehyde (MDA) content of renal tissue, the apoptotic cells percentage in the medium and low dose groups were significantly lower than those in the model group (P <0.05), and MDA content in the low-dose group was significantly lower than that in the medium dose group (P <0.05). The ratio of BCL-2/BAX protein expression in the medium and low dose groups was significantly higher than that in the model group (P<0.05), the ratio in the low groups was significantly higher than that in the medium dose and high dose group by double immunofluorescence staining (P <0.05).

Methods: The BMSCs of rats were isolated, cultured, amplified, identified, and labeled in vitro. 30 Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control group(n = 10), model group(n = 10) and cell therapy group(n = 10). The burned rat model was established. The BMSCs labeled by chlormethyl-benzamidodialkylcarbocyanine(CM-Dil) were transplanted into the rats in cell therapy group by retro-orbital intravenous injection and the saline was injected into the rats in model group. The general status of all rats were observed. The liver tissues of rats were obtained 2 weeks after transplantation, and the pathohistological changes were observed and the pathohistological scores were detected; the apoptotic rate of liver cells was detected by TUNEL method; the engraftment of BMSCs in liver tissues of the rats was observed under laser scanning confocal microscope. Results: 2 weeks after transplantation, the rats in model group were obviously malaise dispirited and the rats in cell therapy group showed obviously better, and the body weight of the rats in cell therapy group was higher than that in model group(P<0.05). The pathohistological results showed the normal liver lobules of the rats in model group disappeared, and the liver cords disordered, and some liver sinusoids dilated and congested, lymphocytes infiltrated with occasional focal aggregating, and cell edema was found, cytoplasm loose and steatosis were seen in liver tissue. However, the pathohistological changes of liver tissue of the rats in cell therapy group were significantly better than those in model group. The pathohistological score of the rats in cell therapy group was significantly lower than that in model group(P<0.05). The TUNEL staining results showed that there were lots of apoptotic liver cells in liver tissue of the rats in model group, and the apoptotic rate of liver cells in cell therapy group was significantly lower than that in model group(P<0.05). CM-Dil labeled BMSCs were found in liver tissue of the rats in cell therapy group under confocal microscope. Conclusion: BMSCs can implant into the damaged liver tissue after transplantation, and BMSCs have an obvious repair effect on liver injury caused by burning, and the possible mechanism may be associated with the inhibiting of apoptosis.',\n",

Adult rats were divided into untreated or sham-operated controls, untreated models of SCII (uSCII) and BM-MSC-transplanted models of SCII (tSCII; labeled with CM-Dill transplanted at 1 h and 24 h after reperfusion). According to evaluation of hind-limb motor function, the motor functions of tSCII rats were significantly better than those of uSCII rats by the seventh day. H&E and TUNEL staining showed that the spinal cords of uSCII rats contained damaged neural cells with nuclear pyknosis and congestion of blood vessels, with a high percentage of apoptotic neural cells, while the spinal cords of tSCII rats were nearly normal with significantly fewer apoptotic neural cells. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence staining revealed that in tSCII rats CASP3 and neurofilament-H (NF-H) levels were 14.57% and 174% those of uSCII rats, respectively, and in tSCII rats the ratio of BAX to BCL2 was reduced by nearly 50%. The differentiation of transplanted CM-Dil-labeled BM-MSCs into neurons and astrocytes was observed in the spinal cords of the tSCII rats under laser scanning confocal microscopy. These results showed that transplantation of BM-MSCs improved functional recovery after SCII via anti-apoptosis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

The dumbbell-shaped jute fiber (DJF)-reinforced friction materials were prepared through compression mold. The friction and wear performance of the DJF were tested using a friction material tester at constant speed. The results showed that the dumbbell-shaped spacing has less influence on the friction coefficients of friction materials. The friction coefficients of DJF have bigger fluctuation compared with that of straight fiber during the temperature-increasing procedure. The wear rate of DJF with dumbbell-shaped spacing of 15 mm was the lowest, except for that when the temperatures were about 200-250°C. Morphologies of wear surfaces of DJF were observed using scanning electron microscopy and the friction characteristics were analyzed. The results showed that reinforced with DJFs in the friction materials can reduce the specific wear rate and the variation in friction coefficient compared with that of straight jute fibers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of silencing SATB1 on cell migration, invasion, apoptosis and resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug arsenic trioxide. Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound-healing assays and trans-well invasion assays, respectively. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by an in situ Cell Death Detection POD Kit, based on terminal deoxynucleotydyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and mRNAs were analyzed by real time qRT-PCR. We found that cell migration and invasion were inhibited and that the proportion of apoptotic cells and sensitivities to the chemotherapeutic drug arsenic trioxide were enhanced by knockdown of SATB1 in U2OS cells. Furthermore, mRNA of ABCC1 and ABCG2 were decreased strikingly after SATB1 silencing. It was concluded that the elevated expression of SATB1 in U2OS cells contributes to maintenance of the malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs ATO, suggesting that silencing SATB1 in the cells might improve the effects of arsenic trioxides in the treatment of osteosarcoma in which SATB1 is over-expressed and that ABCC1 and ABCG2 were involved in SATB1 mediated resistance of U2OS cells to ATO.',\n",

The cadmium chloride solution was administrated by intraperitoneal injection to prepare the rat models of kidney damage. The same volume of normal saline was injected into the rats in blank control goup. The general status and body weights of all rats were observed. The kidney tissue and blood of the rats were obtained 5 weeks later. The renal function indexes including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and β2-microglobulin were detected; the levels of cadmium in the kidney tissue of the rats in various groups were detected by atomic absorption spectrometry; the relative expression level of LC3B and expression level of Beclinl protein were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods, respectively. Results: Obvious depression was seen in the rats in CdCl<inf>2</inf> groups, and the body weights of the rats in high dose group were significantly lower than those in blank control group from 3 weeks after exposure to cadmium (P<0.05); the body weights of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly lower than those in blank control group at the end of this experiment (P<0.05). The results of blood biochemical detection showed that the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and β2-microglobulin of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly higher than those in blank control group (P<0.05), and the levels of creatinine of the rats in high dose group were significantly higher than those in low dose group (P<0.05); the levels of blood urea nitrogen of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly higher than those in low dose group (P<0.05). The results of atomic absorption spectrometry showed that there were a small amount of cadmium accumulation of the rats in blank control group, but a large amount of metal cadmium accumulated in the kidney tissue were seen in low, middle and high dose groups and the levels of cadmium were increased with the increasing of the exposure dose; the levels of cadmium of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly higher than those in low dose group (P< 0.05); the levels of cadmium of the rats in high dose group were significantly higher than those in middle dose group (P<0.05). The immunohistochemistry results showed that the expression levels of Beclinl protein in the kidney tissue of the rats in CdCl<inf>2</inf> groups were significantly higher than those in blank control group (P<0.05), and the expression levels of Beclinl protein of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly higher than those in low dose group (P<0.05); the expression levels of Beclinl protein of the rats in high dose group were significantly higher than those in middle dose group (P<0.05). The Western blotting results showed that the relative expression levels of LC3B protein in the kidney tissue of the rats in CdCl<inf>2</inf> groups were significantly higher than those in blank control group (P<0.5), and the relative expression levels of LC3B protein in the kidney tissue of the rats in middle dose group and high dose group were significantly higher than those in low dose group (P<0.05).

       " 'CNMnFJtf': {'abstract': 'The composition of particulate matter (PM) emitted from animal feeding operations (AFOs) is complex, and those particulates have negative impact on the health of people and animal in and near the AFOs. To better understand the degree of pollution caused by those PMs, it is necessary to conduct real-time measurement, such as particle sizes and concentrations and so on. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility and effectiveness of the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) on measuring PM emitted from AFOs. An APS was firstly employed to measure the size distribution of the glass sphere powder and vegetable oil with different attributes in the laboratory. The measurement results were compared with those simultaneously measured by micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI). Then particulate matter emitted from a cattle feedlot was measured by APS at real-time. The result showed that APS performed well when using it to measure two types of glass sphere powder and vegetable oil in the laboratory. According to linear regression analysis, there was correlation between the cumulative mass concentrations of glass sphere powder obtained by APS and MOUDI, as well as the vegetable oil. Both of the values of determination coefficient R<sup>2</sup> were greater than 0.9. APS also performed well when using it to measure the particulate emitted from the cattle feedlot since it well recorded the pollution scenarios and reflected the variation of the air pollutant. APS provided values of geometric mean diameter, number concentration and mass concentration, which can be used to evaluate pollution level of particulates emitted from animal feeding operation from different aspects.',\n",

The process of this algorithm can be divided into recursive fusion estimation based on time and adaptive weighted fusion algorithm based on space. The algorithm needs no prior probability distributing knowledge of measurement data, and is easy to realize with simple programming and calculation.

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of the herbal medicine called Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP) as an adjunct to carbamazepine (CBZ) in patients with bipolar disorders. One hundred and twenty-four bipolar depressed and 111 manic patients were randomized to treatment with CBZ alone, CBZ plus FEWP, or equivalent placebo for 12 weeks. CBZ was initiated at 300 mg/day and FEWP was given at a fixed dose of 36 g/day. Efficacy measures included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S). CBZ monotherapy produced significantly greater improvement on manic measures at week 2 through endpoint and CGI-S of depression at endpoint compared to placebo. CBZ monotherapy also yielded significantly higher clinical response rates than placebo on bipolar depression (63.8% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.044) and mania (87.8% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.012). Compared to CBZ monotherapy, adjunctive FEWP with CBZ resulted in significantly better outcomes on the three measures of depression at week 4 and week 8 and significantly greater clinical response rate in depressed subjects (84.8% vs. 63.8%, p = 0.032), but failed to produce significantly greater improvement on manic measures and the response rate in manic subjects. There was a lesser incidence of dizziness and fatigue in the combination therapy compared to CBZ monotherapy. These results suggest that adjunctive FEWP has additive beneficial effects in bipolar patients, particularly for those in depressive phase. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether FEWP could ameliorate stress-associated behavior in rats. Following the exposure to enhanced single prolonged stress (ESPS) paradigm, consisting of 2-hr constraint, 20-min forced swimming, ether-induced loss of consciousness, and an electric foot shock, animals were administered orally with FEWP (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg daily) or vehicle for 2 weeks. Animals were then tested in the open field, elevated plus-maze, and Morris water maze. ESPS exposure resulted in pronounced anxiety-like behavior, without impairing locomotor activity, as indicated by significant decreases of time spent and number of entries into open arms in the elevated plus-maze test, and unaltered distance traveled in the open field test compared to unexposed animals. ESPS-exposed animals also displayed marked cognitive impairments, with significant increases of distance traveled and the escape latency to the underwater platform, and a striking decrease of time spent in the target quadrant with and without the removal of the platform in the water maze test. However, repeated treatment with FEWP, particularly at higher doses, reversed the aforementioned behavioral values in the elevated plus-maze and water maze tests to the levels similar to unexposed animals. These results indicate that FEWP possesses anxiolytic and cognition-improving effects and may be an effective herbal preparation for the treatment of stress-associated conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

       " 'bENNIWBW': {'abstract': 'Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of long-acting injectable risperidone (LAIR) in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 48 schizophrenia patients with symptoms lasting over 1 year were collected, and treated with LAIR and oral risperidone tablets for 4 weeks followed by LAIR alone for 8 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scales for severity (CGI-S) and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The adverse reactions were evaluated using the TESS, AIMS, BARS Scale, laboratory indexes, vital signs, medical and electrocardiographic examinations. Results: After treatment with LAIR alone for 8 weeks, the total effective rate (PANSS reduced ≥ 30% ) was 80.5%; mean reduction in CGI-S was 2.1; the rate of patients with increased PSP ≥ 7 was 85.32%. LAIR mildly affected weight-gain profile and caused less extrapyramidal reactions. There were no significant changes in vital signs, medical and electrocardiographic examinations, but 7.0% patients had an increase in glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activity. Conclusions: LAIR significantly improves the social performance in patients with schizophrenia, and can be used as the first line antipsychotic for monotherapy.',\n",

       " '3WidqG4K': {'abstract': 'On July 29, 2007, a severe coalmine-flooded disaster occurred in central China and 69 miners were trapped in an about 1400. m underground coal pit. Fortunately, all of them were rescued after 75. h of the ordeal. At 3 and 6. months after the disaster, psychopathological profiles, plasma levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were evaluated in 48 survivors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was performed at 6. months. The prevalence of PTSD was 35.4% (17/48) at 3. months and 31.3% (15/48) at 6. months post-disaster, with high rates of comorbid symptoms. Risk factors for PTSD included previous traumatic experience, less than 5. years of being a miner, in an extremely exhausted or sick during the disaster, poor interpersonal relationship and poor sleep quality experienced before the disaster. Mean plasma cortisol levels at 6. months, but not at 3. months, were significantly higher in PTSD-positive subjects than the negative, and positively correlated with the severity of several comorbid symptoms. Either whole or regional brain volumes of PTSD-positive subjects were not significantly different from PTSD-negative subjects, but PTSD subjects had significantly reduced fractional anisotropy values in the right posterior cingulum and bilateral hippocampal body compared to subjects without PTSD. These results suggest that traumatic exposure in severe coalmining disasters results in considerable psychological consequences, with highly prevalent PTSD and comorbid symptoms, which are associated with previous traumatic experience, shorter-length underground services, and poor interpersonal relationships and sleep quality experienced before the disaster. Baseline cortisol level may be a useful biological predictor for different phases of the development of PTSD. The aberrant connectivity of the hippocampus and the cingulum may represent an early pathological response to trauma exposure. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

       " 'lO3z4mdB': {'abstract': 'Background The relationship between age at onset (AAO) and major depression (MD) has been studied in US, European and Chinese populations. However, larger sample studies are needed to replicate and extend earlier findings. Methods We re-examined the relationship between AAO and the clinical features of recurrent MD in Han Chinese women by analyzing the phase I (N=1848), phase II (N=4169) and total combined data (N=6017) from the CONVERGE project. Linear, logistic, multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the association of AAO with continuous, binary and categorical variables. Results The effect size of the association between AAO and clinical features of MD was quite similar in the phase I and phase II samples. These results confirmed that MD patients with earlier AAO tended to suffer more severe, recurrent and chronic illness and cases of MD with earlier AAO showed increased neuroticism, greater family history and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, we showed that earlier AAO of MD in Han Chinese women was associated with premenstrual symptoms, postnatal depression, a highly authoritarian or cold childhood parental rearing style and a reduced probability for having melancholia. Limitations Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. Conclusions MD with earlier AAO in Han Chinese women shows a distinct set of clinical features which are similar to those reported in Western populations. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.',\n",

It is a new record of Cladocera in China. Dalian Fisheries University has initiated a saline water research program including its autecology, reproductive biology, feeding ecology and perspective as live food for marine fish larviculture. However, the effect of light on the ingestion capacity is not reported. A direct counting method was used to estimate the ingestion capacity of Moina mongolica Daday at different light intensity (8500 lx, 7000 lx, 5000 lx, 2000lx and 500 lx), photoperiods (L:D 0:24, 6:18, 12:12, 18:6 and 24:0), spectra (blue light and green light) and common light intensity in laboratory. The experimental animals collected from Lake Xiaochi in Yuncheng city, Shanxi Province in China, in 1982, were cultured in marine water at laboratory for 22 years, during which they were fed by Chlorella sp. . The experiment was carried out in illumination culture chambers (HPG-400). Water temperature is 25±1°C. The salinity is about 32. pH value is 8. 2. The results showed that, the ingestion capacity of M. mongolica at light intensity 7000 lx was highest. The clearance rates of adult and young animal were 0.528 ± 0.009 and 0.495 ± 0.014 ml/ (ind·h), respectively) and grazing rates were 1.113 ± 0.015 and 1.051 ± 0.008 μC/(ind·h), respectively. At the blue light, the clearance rates and the grazing rates of M. mongolica is better than those at the green group. The ingestion capacity of adult M. mongolica fed on Chlorella sp. was the best in L:D= 12:12 group. The clearance rates of adult and young animal were 0.461 and 0.355 ml/(ind·h), and grazing rates were 1.242 and 1.005μC/(ind·h). The worst ingestion capacity was observed in L:D = 0:24 group. The clearance rates of adult and young M. mongolica were 0.070 and 0.050 ml/ (ind·h), respectively. Under common light intensity in laboratory, the ingestion capacity of M. mongolica fed on Chlorella sp. was highest in 7:00-11:00 and 15:00-19:00.',\n",

The blood samples were harvested from inferior vena cava at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 post scald hours (PSH) to determine the levels of MTL,SS, SP and VIP with radioimmunoassay. Results: (1) The levels of MTL and SP were (198 ± 28),(61 ± 10) ng/L, respectively, in NC group. The levels of MTL and SP in S group reached their minimum values [(110 ± 15), (30 ± 5)ng/L, respectively]at 6 PSH, then ascended slowly, peaked at 72 PSH but still lower than those in NC group (P < 0.05).

Methods: Fifty healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into scald (n = 40) and control (n = 10) groups. Rats in scald group were inflicted with 3096 TBSA full-thickness scald, and received an intraperitoneally injection of Ringer lactate solution (50 mg/kg) for resuscitation, while those in control group had similar treatment with the exception of scald. Rats in control group and scald group were sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 24 post scald hour (PSH, 10 rats at each time point) for collection of 4 cm of colonic tissue, 5 cm proximal to the cecum. A segment of colonic wall, 1 cm in length, was obtained from the middle of the harvested segment of colon, and it was fixed with 396 glutaraldehyde or 1096 formaldehyde. The samples fixed with glutaraldehyde were used to observe ultrastructural alterations under transmission electron microscope, while that with formaldehyde were used to observe expressions of GRP78 and caspase-12 in colonic wall by immunohistochemical assay. Results: The colonic smooth muscle cells of rats in control group showed regular arrangment, their organelles were abundant, nucleus centrally located, euchromatin distributed evenly with more abundant mitochondrial cristae and less smooth endoplasmic reticulum, neuronal organelles were abundant in intermuscular plexus, and ICC could be seen in the neighborhood of neurons. The colonic smooth muscle cells appeared in irregular and disordered manner in scald group, perinuclear space was widened, intercellular vacuoles were observed, mitochondria showed vacuolation degeneration with dissolved and condensed cristae, rough endoplasmic reticula were dilated with partial dissolution, and perinuclear cytoplasm of ICC was obviously decreased. The expression of GRP78 was increased in scald group at 3, 6, 12 PSH (4.3 ± 0.9, 6.0 ± 0.7, 4.8 ± 1.1 score) as compared with that in control group (2.4 ± 0.7 score, P < 0.05). The expression of caspase-12 in scald group at 6, 12, 24 PSH was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). GRP78 was consistantly expressed in cytoplasm in control group, while in scald group, it mainly appeared in mucosa, myenteric plexus, and stromal cells, but only moderately or lightly expressed in smooth muscle cells. The expression of GRP78 was positive in scald group at 3, 6, 12 PSH, strongly positive at 6 PSH, and it was also expressed in cytoplasm in control group. The expression of caspase-12 in scald group was not obviously positive at 3 PSH, and weakly positive at 6, 24 PSH, but strongly positive at 12 PSH, while no expression was shown in control group. Conclusions: Marked pathological changes are observed in enteric nervous system-interstitial cells of Cajal-smooth muscle in rats with severe scald injury. It may be related with cellular injuries induced by caspase-12 apoptotic pathways through activated endoplasmic reticulum stress.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of rhEGF on wound healing of skin donor site. METHODS: A total of 32 cases needs wound healing by skin grafting were collected, including 18 males and 14 females. The 32 skin graft donor site wounds were randomly divided into control and treatment groups. In the treatment group, the absorbent gauze was sprinkle soaked with rhEGF (15 mL/ramus, 2 000 IU/mL) and covered the donor site, twice per day. In the control group, donor site was covered by physiological saline gauze and wrapped with dressing, twice per day. After 48 hours, semi-exposed therapy was performed. The healing time of wounds, the systemic and local adverse reactions of patients and blood routine examination and renal function detection prior to and after treatment were observed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The healing time of wound in the rhEGF treatment group was shorter than that in the control group with significant differences (P < 0.01). No Adverse events or side effects were observed in the rhEGF treatment group. rhEGF can shorten wound healing time, reduce scar hyperplasia, and accelerate epithelization at the graft donor.',\n",

Methods: CSMC isolated from healthy adult Wistar rat were cultured and divided into scald serum group (SS) and normal serum group (NS) according to the random number talbe. Two normal Wistar rats were used, one of which was inflicted with deep partial-thickness scald. Serum was obtained from blood collected from these two rats respectively and diluted to 20% in concentration. Serum from scald and normal rats were respectively added to the culture of CSMC in SS and NS groups. The expression of actin and the relative content of β-tubulin in CSMC was respectively determined with flow cytometry and Western blot at post treatment hour (PTH) 1 , 3, 6, and 12 (with 10 samples in each group at each time point). Data were processed with t test. Results: Fluorescence intensity of actin in SS group at PTH 1,3,6, and 12 was respectively 59 ± 4 , 26 ± 6 , 39 ± 6 , and 42 ± 6 , all significantly lower than those in NS group (95 ± 10, 91 ± 10, 102 ± 9, and 97 ± 9, with t value respectively 10.528, 18.069, 18.748, 16.647, P <0.05 or P <0.01).

       " 'ca9X4t6t': {'abstract': 'Distraction osteogenesis requires a long consolidation period and has a low but real failure rate. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) accelerate bone deposition in fractures and critical-sized bone defects. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising reagent for inducing angiogenesis, and is an essential coordinator of extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and bone formation in the growth plate. However, their effects on mandibular distraction osteogenesis are unknown. We investigated the effect of local delivery of plasmid pIRES-hBMP-2-hVEGF165 into a distraction area by electroporation-mediated approach.A New Zealand rabbit model were used. Activation of the device was commenced after 3 days of latency period and proceeded at the rate of 0.8 mm per day for 7 days. After the completion of activation, the rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups: group A: recombinant plasmid 2 μg (0.1 μg/μL) pIRES-hVEGF165-hBMP2 was injected into the distraction area after the completion of activation; group B: recombinant plasmid pIRES-hBMP2 was injected into the distraction area; group C: recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165 was injected into the distraction area; group D: pIRES was injected into the distraction area, and group E: normal saline was injected into the distraction area. After injection every group used electroporation. Subsequently, the rabbits were examined by quantitative computed tomography, mechanical testing, and histomorphometric analysis.BMD of newly formed bone of the distraction area in groups A, B, and C were remarkably higher than those of groups D and E at different times (P < 0.001). At 4 and 8 weeks of consolidation, the crushing strength of 3 points of the newly formed bone in group A was remarkably higher than those of groups B, C, D, and E (P < 0.01). The results demonstrated statistically remarkable increase in regenerated bone in the gene-transfected groups.Electroporation-mediated transfecting recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165-hBMP2 could produce a satisfactory proceeding of osteogenesis and calcification, which surpassed that of the control group. This finding indicates that a combination of VEGF and BMP may make osteogenesis and angiogenesis appear at the same time. Furthermore, it may magnify the effect of single growth factor, and promote growth and reparative process of bone. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.',\n",

Based on previous study, the authors used New Zealand rabbits bilateral mandibular distraction model and used electroporation mediate gene therapy at different time, to explore the optimal time for gene therapy and obtain a better effect. METHODS: Forty-eight New-Zealand rabbits were used; after accomplished osteotomy and implant distraction devices on mandible bilaterly, the rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: groups A, B, and C were transfected recombinant plasmids pIRES-hBMP2-hVEGF165 via electroporation-mediated approach at latency period, distraction period, and consolidation period, respectively. Group D is a control group, only distracted without gene transfection. After 3 days of latency period, the device was activated at the rate of 1 mm per day for 10 days. Three rabbits of each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of consolidation, respectively. The mandibles were harvested; the left was subject to radiograph examination for bone healing, and quantitative computed tomography detect for the bone mineral density (BMD) of newly formed bone in the distraction gap. The biomechanical properties of the new generation bone at the fourth and eighth weeks of consolidation of each group were detected using 3-point bending test. RESULTS: The BMD and the stiffness of newly formed bone increased with the pass of the consolidation time in each group. After 1 week of consolidation, there is no significant difference of BMD among groups A, B, and C. However, the BMD of groups A, B, and C is higher than that of group D. After 2, 4, and 8 weeks of consolidation, the BMD of group B is significantly higher than those of groups A, C, and D. The biomechanical parameters are also higher in group B than those of groups A, C, and D after 4 and 8 weeks of consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: It is better to transfect gene at distraction period than at other stages of DO; in this way, we can obtain more remarkable effect on new bone formation. It suggests that the distraction stage is the optimal time for gene therapy. Copyright © 2013 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD.',\n",

Primary splenic lymphocytes were exposed to DEHP/MEHP. ELISA and Western blotting were used to detect proteins. Confocal-microscopy was used to examine nuclear translocation. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) DNA binding activity was examined by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. DEHP significantly increased IL-4 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) level, and reduced Th1/Th2 ratio (reflected by IFN-γ/IL-4) with 5 μg/L Concanavalin A (ConA) treatment. While MEHP reduced Th1/Th2 ratio (represented by IFN-γ/IL-6). IL-4 mRNA was significantly increased by DEHP but not by MEHP after PMA and Ion treatment. DEHP significantly inhibited NFATp protein in cytosol and nucleus. DEHP augmented nuclear translocation of NFATc in transfected EL4 cells and NFAT DNA-binding activity.

Aim: To investigate the diversity distributions of allelic frequencies of 15 loci from a sample from the Chinese Xibe ethnic group in Liaoning. Subjects and methods: Fifteen STR loci for 150 unrelated Xibe individuals from Liaoning, China were amplified simultaneously in a fluorescence-based reaction using a 2720 Thermal cycler (ABI). Separation and detection of the amplified product were conducted with the Li-COR 4300 DNA Analyzer. Results: In total, 117 alleles were observed, with the corresponding allele frequencies ranging from 0.001 to 0.507. D18S51 had the highest polymorphism (PIC=0.840) among all 15 STR loci, whereas TPOX had the lowest (PIC=0.590). The power of discrimination ranged from 0.801 for TH01 locus to 0.957 for D18S51 locus, whereas the power of exclusion ranged from a minimum 0.316 for TPOX locus to a maximum 0.720 for D21S11 locus. The phylogenetic tree established among worldwide populations showed that the Xibe population is far from other populations.

The codon optimized capsid genes of Norovirus GGII1, GGII3, GGII4 and GGII7 were respectively expressed in insect cell Sf9 using baculovirus vector. The results showed that, compared to the wild type, the expression levels of the optimized genes were remarkably increased. The assembly of norovirus-like particles was observed in the Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing the capsid protein.

The immunological mechanism of NV infection and the approaches used to prevent infection remain to be elucidated. In this study, the specific immune responses of BALB/c mice were assessed following intranasal immunization with a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing the genogroup II4 (GGII/4) norovirus capsid protein. Analysis of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies specific for the recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) of NV demonstrated that a high level of humoral immunity developed following immunization. Mucosal immune responses were also detectable in stool, intestinal homogenates, lung homogenates, and lung lavage samples. Specific cellular immune responses were observed in NV VLPs-restimulated splenocytes by ELISPOT and Th1/Th2 cytokine cytometric array (CBA). Serum IgG subclass analysis showed that a balanced Th1- and Th2-like cellular immune response was induced in BALB/c mice following immunization with recombinant adenovirus. These findings demonstrate that the intranasal immunization of a recombinant adenovirus expressing the NV capsid protein is an efficient strategy to stimulate systemic, mucosal, and cellular Th1/Th2 immune responses in mice, and could serve as a novel approach for designing NV vaccines. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: To determine the dominant circulating NoV genotypes and strains associated with pediatric cases of acute gastroenteritis in Beijing, China. Study design: Fecal samples were obtained from 1126 children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2004 to November 2007. NoV RNA was amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed to determine the dominant circulating genotypes and strains. Results: NoVs were detected in 8.88% of patients, GII.4 being the dominant genotype. Ehime/05-30 was the dominant strain during 2004-2005, whereas 2006b dominated during 2006-2007. The homology of nucleotide and amino acid sequences among full-length VP1 of 15 randomly selected NoV strains was 91.6-99.6% and 94.5-99.6%, respectively. Recombination between NoV genotypes was frequent among the isolates. Conclusions: The predominant circulating genotype of NoV infections in Beijing is GII.4, but the dominant strains of this virus responsible for gastroenteritis epidemics are evolving rapidly. A global surveillance network may be needed to identify trends in molecular evolution of NoVs for prevention of future epidemics. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.',\n",

       " '2OyQNTQV': {'abstract': 'Background. Avian influenza virus H5N1 is a major concern as a potential global pandemic. It is thought that multiple key events must take place before efficient human-to-human transmission of the virus occurs. The first step in overcoming host restriction is viral entry which is mediated by HA, responsible for both viral attachment and viral/host membrane fusion. HA binds to glycans-containing receptors with terminal sialic acid (SA). It has been shown that avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to α2,3-linked SAs, while human influenza A viruses exhibit a preference for α2,6-linked SAs. Thus it is believed the precise linkage of SAs on the target cells dictate host tropism of the viruses. Results. We demonstrate that H5N1 HA/HIV pseudovirus can efficiently transduce several human cell lines including human lung cells. Interestingly, using a lectin binding assay we show that the presence of both α2,6-linked and α2,3-linked SAs on the target cells does not always correlate with efficient transduction. Further, HA substitutions of the residues implicated in switching SA-binding between avian and human species did not drastically affect HA-mediated transduction of the target cells or target cell binding. Conclusion. Our results suggest that a host factor(s), which is yet to be identified, is required for H5N1 entry in the host cells.',\n",

       " '50TpeJlU': {'abstract': 'Background: Human adenovirus serotype 41 (Ad41) is a natural pathogen of the digestive tract and can cause gastroenteritis. There has been interest in reconstructing Ad41 as a gene delivery vector targeting the gastrointestinal tract, which is hampered by its fastidiousness. Methods: An Ad41 E1B55K-transduced 293 cell line (293E12) was established as the packaging cell line. A backbone plasmid (pAdbone41) and a shuttle plasmid (pSh41-CMV) were constructed based on the Ad41 genome. Replication-defective adenovirus (Ad41-GFP) was rescued in 293E12 after being transfected with the linearized adenoviral plasmid, which was generated by homologous recombination of pAdbone41 and the shuttle plasmid carrying the GFP gene in Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. The packaging ability of 293E12, the stability of the Ad41-GFP genome and the acid-resistant property of Ad41-GFP were all investigated. Results: A 293E12 cell could produce approximately 9000 viral particles of Ad41-GFP, which is close to the amount in the control virus (Ad5-GFP) amplified in one 293 cell. Ad41-GFP contained a genetically stable genome after being passaged eight times in 293E12 cells. More significantly, Ad41-GFP was more resistant to acid exposure than Ad5-GFP. It retained almost complete viability when exposed to hydrochloric acid with a pH value of 2 for 30 min, whereas Ad5-GFP lost 99% of its viability under the same conditions. Ad41-GFP was also more tolerant to treatment with artificial digestive fluid. Conclusions: An Ad41 vector system was successfully constructed, which consisted of the backbone plasmid, shuttle plasmid and packaging cell line 293E12. This system can be utilized to generate genetically stable and acid-resistant recombinant Ad41 carrying any gene of interest. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",

A recent molecular analysis identified H. formosensis and H. tientsinensis as junior synonyms of H. latimera. We used three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes to further delineate species boundaries in Helice and to add to knowledge of the historical biogeography of the genus. The molecular data revealed deep divergences between the H. formosensis-latimera-tientsinensis complex and H. tridens. Clear genetic separations with incomplete lineage sorting and convincing morphological divergences were detected among H. formosensis, H. latimera, and H. tientsinensis, and a coalescence analysis revealed negligible gene flow among these species, except for weak unidirectional gene flow from H. formosensis to H. latimera. The estimated divergence time of 1.42-1.92 Ma between the H. formosensls-latimera-tientsinensis complex and H. tridens is consistent with the opening of the Tsushima/Korea Strait (1.71-1.52 Ma). The divergence time (-22-730 ka) among H. formosensis, H. latimera, and H. tientsinensis indicates that the Taiwan Strait acted as a biogeographic barrier during major falls In sea level during the Pleistocene. Our findings indicate that H. formosensis, H. latimera, and H. tientsinensis are valid species, and that straits (Tokara Strait, Tsushima/Korea Strait, and Taiwan Strait), the Okinawa Trough, and currents (Kuroshio Current, Tsushima Current, and Taiwan Strait Warm Current) have acted as geographic barriers resulting in allopatric speciation among onshore marine animals in the northwestern Pacific. © 2009 Zoological Society of Japan.',\n",

To provide more insight into the prevalence of HAstV gastroenteritis in China, 664 fecal samples were collected from children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2005 to November 2007. The samples were analyzed genetically. All eight serotypes (genotypes) of HAstVs were screened using RT-PCR assays targeting the ORF2 region in the study. The assays detected HAstVs in 52 (7.8%) of the patients, with HAstV-1 (50/52) being the dominant genotype during the study period. Two minor genotypes, HAstV-6 and HAstV-3, were also detected. Partial sequencing of the 50 HAstV-1 strains showed that the homology of the nucleotide sequence of the ORF1a region between these strains was 88.4-100%, whereas the homology of the amino acid sequences was 95.6-100%. In the ORF2 partial region, the nucleotide identities ranged from 91.5% to 100%, and amino acid identities ranged from 97.3% to 100%. The identity of the whole genome sequence between four randomly examined HAstV-1 strains was 91-99%. No recombination events were observed in HAstVs in this study.

An effective vaccination regime against RV can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virus-like particles formed by RV VP2 and VP6 (VLP2/6), as well as that of recombinant adenovirus expressing RV VP6 (rAd), in eliciting protective immunities against RV. However, the efficacy of such prime-boost strategy, which incorporates VLP and rAd in inducing protective immunities against RV, has not been addressed. We assessed the immune effects of different regimens in mice, including rAd prime-VLP2/6 boost (rAd+VLP), VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost (VLP+rAd), rAd alone, and VLP alone. Results. Mice immunized with the VLP+rAd regimen elicit stronger humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses than those immunized with other regimens. RV challenging experiments showed that the highest reduction (92.9%) in viral shedding was achieved in the VLP+rAd group when compared with rAd+VLP (25%), VLP alone (75%), or rAd alone (40%) treatment groups. The reduction in RV shedding in mice correlated with fecal IgG (r = 0.95773, P = 0.04227) and IgA (r = 0.96137, P = 0.038663). Conclusions. A VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost regimen is effective in conferring immunoprotection against RV challenge in mice.

However, studies on the seroepidemeology of hMPV are very limited in China. To assess the seroprevalence of hMPV infection in China, we tested a total of 1,156 serum specimens for the presence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody in children and adults free of acute respiratory illness in Beijing, China by using hMPV nucleocapsid (N) protein as an antigen. As a control, we used the human serum antibody against the N protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the most important viral agent responsible for ARIs in children. Results: The seropositive rate for hMPV increased steadily with age from 67% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. However, the rate dropped slightly between 6 mo and 1 yr of age. The seropositive rate for hRSV also increased steadily with age from 71% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. In children aged six months to six years, the seropositive rates for the anti-hRSV IgG antibody were significantly higher than those for hMPV. Additionally, IgG antibody titers to hMPV and hRSV were significantly higher in adults than in young children. Consistent with the seropositive rates, the geometric mean titer of anti-hMPV IgG antibody was lower than that of anti-hRSV IgG antibody in children aged six months to six years. Conclusions: Our results indicate that similar to hRSV, exposure to hMPV is ubiquitous in the Beijing population. However, the seroprevalence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody is lower than that of hRSV in children between six months and six years old, which suggests a different number of repeat infections or a different response to infections. © 2011 Lu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.',\n",

For HA, 16 distinct subtypes (H1-H16) exist, while nine exist for NA. The epidemic strains of H1N1 IAV change frequently and cause annual seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics, such as the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic. The recent introduction of pandemic A/H1N1 IAV (H1N1pdm virus) into humans re-emphasizes the public health concern about H1N1 IAV. Several studies have identified conserved epitopes within specific HA subtypes that can be used for diagnostics. However, immune specific epitopes in H1N1 IAV have not been completely assessed. In this study, linear epitopes on the H1N1pdm viral HA protein were identified by peptide scanning using libraries of overlapping peptides against convalescent sera from H1N1pdm patients. One epitope, P5 (aa 58-72) was found to be immunodominant in patients and to evoke high titer antibodies in mice. Multiple sequence alignments and in silico coverage analysis showed that this epitope is highly conserved in influenza H1 HA [with a coverage of 91.6% (9,860/10,767)] and almost completely absent in other subtypes [with a coverage of 3.3% (792/23,895)]. This previously unidentified linear epitope is located outside the five well-recognized antigenic sites in HA.

The typical prevalence pattern of hMPV involves a shift of the predominant subtype within one or two years. However, hMPV_A2, in particular hMPV_A2b, has circulated worldwide with a several years long term high epidemic. To study this distinct epidemic behavior of hMPV_A2, we analyzed 294 sequences of partial G genes of the virus from different countries. Molecular evolutionary data indicates that hMPV_A2 evolved toward heterogeneity faster than the other subtypes. Specifically, a Bayesian skyline plot analysis revealed that hMPV_A2 has undergone a generally upward fluctuation since 1997, whereas the other subtypes experienced only one upward fluctuation. Although hMPV_A2 showed a lower value of mean dN/dS than the other subtypes, it had the largest number of positive selection sites. Meanwhile, various styles of mutation were observed in the mutation hotspots of hMPV_A2b. Bayesian phylogeography analysis also revealed two fusions of diffusion routes of hMPV_A2b in India (June 2006) and Beijing, China (June 2008). Sequences of hMPV_A2b retrieved from GenBank boosted simultaneously with the two fusions respectively, indicating that fusion of genetic transmission routes from different regions improved survival of hMPV_A2. Epidemic and evolutionary dynamics of hMPV_A2b were similar to those of hMPV_A2. Overall, our findings provide important molecular insights into hMPV epidemics and viral variation, and explain the occurrence of an atypical epidemic of hMPV_A2, particularly hMPV_A2b. © 2012 Li et al.',\n",

Using the inferred species-tree as criterion, we recombine the rank of subfamilies and genera in the Salangidae, and erect a new genus Neosalangichthys.

HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory disease, whereas HBoV2-4 are mainly detected in enteric infections. Although the prevalence of HBoVs in humans has been studied in some regions, it has not been well addressed globally. Methodology/Principal Findings: Cross-reactivity of anti-VP2 antibodies was detected between HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in mouse and human serum. The prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in Beijing, China, using a competition ELISA assay based on virus-like particles of HBoV1-4. The seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults (≥15 years old; n = 142). The seropositive rate of HBoV1 was higher than that of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in individuals older than 0.5 years. Furthermore, IgG seroconversion of HBoV1 (10/31, 32.3%), HBoV2 (8/31, 25.8%), and HBoV3 (2/31, 6.5%) was found in paired sera collected from children with respiratory tract infections who were positive for HBoV1 according to PCR analysis. Conclusions/Significance: Our data indicate that HBoV1 is more prevalent than HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in the population we sampled in Beijing, China, suggesting that HBoV species may play differential roles in disease. © 2012 Guo et al.',\n",

In the past few decades, rapid economic development in the coastal areas of China has led to the interruption and destruction of an increasing number of tidal marshes. The growing interest in tidal marsh restoration has increased the need to understand the relationship between geomorphological features and fish assemblages in the design of marsh restoration projects. We studied temporal variations in, and the effects of creek geomorphological features on, the estuarine tidal creek fish community. Using modified channel nets, we sampled fish monthly from March 2007 to February 2008 from seven tidal creeks along an intertidal channel system in Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve. Fourteen creek geomorphological variables were measured or derived to characterize intertidal creek geomorphological features. The Gobiidae, with 10 species, was the most speciesrich family. The most abundant fish species were Liza affinis, Chelon haematocheilus, and Lateolabrax maculatus. The fish community was dominated by juvenile marine transients, which comprised about 80% of the total catch. The highest abundance of fish occurred in June and July, and the highest biomass occurred in December. Canonical redundancy analyses demonstrated that depth, steepness, cross-sectional area, and volume significantly affected the fish species assemblage. L. affinis favored small creeks with high elevations. Synechogobius ommaturus, Acanthogobius luridus, and Carassius auratus preferred deep, steep creeks with a large cross-sectional area and volume. These findings indicate that the geomorphological features of tidal creeks should be considered in the conservation and sustainable management of fish species and in the restoration of salt marshes. © 2014 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.',\n",

One is adult-onset citrullinemia type II (CTLN2) and another is neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). A child with CD and who had failure to thrive (FTT) and dyslipidemia as main clinical manifestations is reported here. Both the weight- and length-for-age at 18 months dropped below the 3rd percentile in the corresponding WHO anthropometry percentile charts, while blood biochemical analysis revealed dramatically increased triglyceride and total cholesterol, together with reduced HDL-cholesterol. Inquiries revealed his aversion to rice and fondness for fish since the age of one year, a peculiar habit which could not be corrected. Since the age of two years, the peculiar diet became more obvious, and slightly increased citrulline and threonine levels were detected on blood amino acid analysis. At the age of two years and five months he was suspected to have CD. Since then, he has been fed in accordance with his own food preferences, and FTT improved gradually, with weight-for-age, in particular, recovering beyond the 3rd percentile at three years of age, and dyslipidemia was also ameliorated gradually. SLC25A13 gene analysis revealed a homozygote of 851de14, and CD was thus confirmed. Diet survey at four years and seven months revealed a fondness for high-protein and low-carbohydrate foods, such as seafood, meat, eggs and milk. This child presented with FTT and dyslipidemia as main clinical manifestations and this was a novel CD phenotype different from NICCD and CTLN2.',\n",

We herein reported the etiology distribution feature in a cohort of 285 Chinese patients with NDDs. Although concrete NDD etiologies in 48.4 of the total patients could not be identified, genetic diseases (with the proportion of 35.8 in the total cases) including inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and congenital dysmorphic diseases, constituted the commonest etiology category for NDDs in this study. The two key experimental technologies in pediatric metabolomics, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), proved to be substantially helpful for the exploration of the NDD etiologies in this clinical investigation. The findings in this paper provided latest epidemiologic information on the etiology distribution of NDDs in Chinese, and the syndromic NDDs caused by citrin deficiency and the novel chromosomal karyotype, respectively, further expanded the etiology spectrum of NDDs.

Two phenotypes for human citrin deficiency have been described, namely the adult-onset citrullinemia type II (CTLN2) and the neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). However, citrin deficiency currently remains a perplexing and poorly recognized disorder. In particular, description of post-NICCD clinical presentations before CTLN2 onset is rather limited. Analysis of SLC25A13 mutations, identification of dysmorphic erythrocytes, hepatobiliary scintigraphic imaging and investigation of post-NICCD clinical presentations were performed in a citrin-deficient cohort comprised of 51 cases of children diagnosed with citrin deficiency in a Chinese pediatric center. Twelve SLC25A13 mutations were detected in this cohort, including the novel V411M and G283X mutations. Among the 51 citrin-deficient subjects, 7 cases had echinocytosis, which was associated with more severe biochemical abnormalities. Delayed hepatic discharge and bile duct/bowel visualization were common scintigraphic findings. Moreover, 9 of the 34 post-NICCD cases demonstrated concurrent failure to thrive and dyslipidemia, constituting a clinical phenotype different from NICCD and CTLN2. The novel mutations, echinocytosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphic features and the novel clinical phenotype in this study expanded the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of citrin deficiency, and challenge the traditionally-assumed 'apparently healthy' period after the NICCD state for this disease entity.\",\n",

       " 'dpBhQlDJ': {'abstract': 'Background: Clinically affected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients present a spectrum of genital phenotypes ranging from normal fertility to moderately impaired spermatogenesis and congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD). Little is known about the CF incidence in the Taiwanese population. It has been shown that the CBAVD in men without clinical evidence of CF is associated with a high incidence of mutated CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) alleles. In order to understand the involvement of the CFTR gene in the aetiology of Asian/Taiwanese male infertility, we screened the entirety of the CFTR gene in 36 infertile males with CBAVD. Methods: Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) followed by direct DNA sequencing was used. Results: Five mutations, p.V201M, p.N287K, c.-8G>C (125G>C), p.M469I and p.S895N, were found in five of the patients. p.N287K occurred in the first transmembrane-spanning domain, p.M469I in the first ATP-binding domain and p.S895N in the second transmembrane-spanning domain, were novel. In addition, seven homozygous and seven heterozygous 5T alleles in the intron 8 poly(T) tract were found. The overall frequency of CFTR mutant alleles in Taiwanese CBAVD males was 26 out of 72=36%. This finding was lower than the published frequency of CFTR mutations in other ethnic CBAVD patients (ranging from 50 to 74%). The frequency of p.M470V in Taiwanese CBAVD patients is not significantly different from that in the general population P=0.12). Conclusions: The results of this study add to the short list of Taiwanese/Asian CFTR mutations. Unlike Caucasian patients, the CFTR mutations cannot account for the majority of Taiwanese CBAVD. This is consistent with the low incidence of CF in the Asian/Taiwanese population. Furthermore, the mutation spectrum of CFTR in CBAVD patients does not overlap with the Caucasian CFTR mutation spectrum. © The Author 2005.

Other untreated seeds were regarded as a control group (abbreviated to CP). All seeds were planted under same condition. The vegetal character of the Catharanthus roseus was observed in detail and contents of Vinblastine and Vincristine in the plants were detected by HPLC. Experimental results indicated that the contents of Vinblastine increased remarkably and Vincristine tended to increase in the plants of the pressure treated groups in comparison to CP. It is also noticed that distributions of variance of the flowers and ill after growth plants are corresponding approximately to that of the contents of Vinblastine. Mechanism of the effects of pressure treatment was discussed qualitatively.',\n",

In this study, oral administration of CXVO (45.0, 90.0, and 135.0 μl/kg) to mice significantly elevated the pain threshold in the hot-plate test and reduced the number of abdominal writhing caused by acetic acid. CXVO (90.0 and 135.0 μl/kg) not only reduced locomotor activity, but also prolonged the sleeping time induced by sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg), and the number of mice with sleeping time over 1 min by sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg) was markedly enlarged by CXVO (45.0, 90.0, 135.0 μl/kg) administration. The three doses of CXVO significantly increased the pain threshold of rabbits with headache due to hot radiation and the level of plasma ET of rats with headache due to nitroglycerin injection. Besides, for the nitroglycerin-induced headache rats, the c-fos gene expression in the brain stem and hypothalamus was remarkably inhibited and the level of plasma CGRP was reduced significantly after CXVO administration at both doses 90.0 and 135.0 μg/kg. The latter dosage could also raise the level of plasma 5-HT markedly. The study suggests that CXVO acts probably as the active ingredient of Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong Hort.

Methods: Retrospective data analysis of 49 consecutive CRAO patients was performed. The visual acuity was 3.0-4.7 in 51% patients, and less than 3.0 in 49%. The averaged visual acuity was 1.5 ± 0.1. All the patients were treated with urokinase perfusion through the ophthalmology artery within the first 6 hours after CRAO attack. Conventional treatment including intra-ocular pressure decreasing, microcirculation improvement, neuroprotection and anti-coagulation were conducted. The visual acuity was detected at the 2, 28 days and 6 months after thrombolysis, and field of visions was detected at 28 days and 6 months after thrombolysis. And the thrombolysis related complications were observed. The correlation of the visual outcome after thrombolysis with the patient's ages, the time thrombolysis when started, and the residual visual acuity at admission were calculated. The complication which was related to cerebral angiography and LIT was explored. Results: Improvement of visual function was achieved after thrombolysis. The averaged visual acuity was 4.2 ± 0.2, 4.4 ± 0.3, 4.6 ± 0.5 at the 2,28 days and 6 months after thrombolysis respectively. 24.5% patients regained visual acuity of > 4.8, and visual field deficit was less than 30% in 34.7% at 28 days. 6 months later, 36.7% patients regained visual acuity of > 4.8. Field deficit was less than 30% in 44.9% patients. The pretreatment residual visual acuity was the significant predictor of good recovery of visual acuity (r=0.292, P < 0.05). There was no ischemic attack and hemorrhagic complication which correlated with cerebral angiography and LIT. Conclusion: LIT is an effective and safe method for CRAO patients.

       " '8JkUIpZs': {'abstract': 'Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic effectiveness of ultrasonography (US)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (PMA) in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer. Methods: From December 2002 to September 2003, 12 Chinese patients with 16 histologically proven lung malignant tumors (6 primary and 10 metastatic) were treated with US-guided PMA. All tumors were located at the peripheral portions of the lung where the tumors were in direct contact with visceral pleura and visualized on US. A total of 21 insertions with 25 applications was administered to the 16 tumors. There was no radiation or chemotherapy combined with PMA. Results: Based on the follow-up period of 6-40 months (average=20 months), seven patients survived without serious complications and five patients died from metastasis after PMA. The size of treated tumors was decreased in all cases (10 tumors with moderate to remarkable area reduction and 6 tumors with mild area reduction). Blood flow in the tumors became either invisible or diminished on color Doppler flow imaging, which showed 9 tumors with no enhancement and 7 tumors with partially decreased enhancement on contrast-enhanced computed tomography after PMA. All patients experienced improvement of clinical symptoms after PMA treatment. Conclusions: Ultrasonography-guided PMA, a mildly invasive procedure, is an effective, safe, and feasible method for treating peripheral lung tumors. Percutaneous microwave ablation provides an alternative therapy for patients with inoperable peripheral lung cancer as well as for patients who refuse radiation or chemotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Design: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. Participants: 19 (22 eyes) healthy age-related cataract patients. Methods: The study was performed in patients who had been operated with phacoemulsification by the same ophthalmologist. Endothelial density and morphological changes in central cornea were examined with CMTF just before operation and on the day of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after operation. Main Outcome Measures: Endothelial density and endothelial morphological images with CMTF. Results: CMTF images reveal that the shape of endothelium is quite different after phacoemulsification. Keratic precipitation, endothelial edema, endothelial absent area and pseudoguttata-like changes can be seen. Also, the resealing process of endothelium adjacent endothelial absent area can be observed.

Painful ophthalmoplegia is a rare disorder characterized by orbital or retro-orbital pain with accompanying paresis or paralysis of one or more of the extraocular motor nerves with or without involvement of the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve. In clinical, other lesions involving the structures within these areas may also cause a painful ophthalmoplegia syndrome, such as ophthalmoplegic migraine, aneurysms of cavernous carotid artery, vasculopathic cranial neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus, nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sphy1 had high similarities with the phytase genes from Medicago truncatula and rice, and acid phosphatase genes from M. truncatula and Arabidopsis. Prokaryotic expression of Sphy1 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) showed that the induced protein had high phytase activities.

The phytase activities in the above tissues were in accordance with their corresponding Sphy1 transcripts. The transcripts of Sphy1 in cotyledons showed an increasing trend from 5 to 30 days after germination, suggesting that Sphy1 had involved the hydrolyses of the organic phosphorus compounds in seeds from the stages of early seed germination to young seedlings in soybean.

In this paper, nineteen rice CBF genes, including seven previously released and twelve unpublished novels, were identified and characterized. The multi-members of rice CBFs (OsCBF1 to OsCBF12) were divergent at the nucleotide and amino acid level. Expression analysis shows that five novel rice CBF genes (OsCBF1, OsCBF2, OsCBF3, OsCBF8, and OsCBF9) responded to short-term (1 h or 3 h) stresses of low temperature, salt stress and dehydration. The transcripts of OsCBF2, OsCBF8 and OsCBF9 in the roots were rapidly elevated when the plants were exposed to low temperatures, suggesting that they were possibly involved in low temperature responses in rice plants. Meanwhile, the expression level of OsCBF2 in leaves was enhanced when exposed to salt stress of 1-3 h, implying that OsCBF2 functioned as a transduction component in the salt stress signal cascade. Various expression patterns in OsCBF1, OsCBF2, OsCBF3, OsCBF8, and OsCBF9 under low temperature, salt and drought conditions, together with the different expression patterns between roots and leaves for each of these indicated that every rice CBF gene has unique and non-redundant functions in the response to the abiotic stresses. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.',\n",

Compared with the control plants, the phytase activities in all the transgenic plants were increased, with the increased range consistent with the expression levels in the transgenic plants. Under the growth conditions with phytate as the sole phosphorus source, the transgenic line 1 plants displayed a high expression level of Sphy1 and shows notable improved growth performance, such as higher fresh weight and dry weight, as well as higher total P content and more accumulative P amount per plant than CK. This clearly indicated that overexpression of Sphy1 could improve the phosphorus acquisition by the extruded Sphy1 phytase in the rhizosphere, where this enzyme could catalyze the degradation of the phytate and release the available Pi for plants. The Sphy1 gene seemed to have a potential value in the creation of new crop cultivars with high phosphorus use efficiency. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2009.',\n",

A Triticum aestivum PT gene denoted as TaPT2 was functionally characterized in this study. TaPT2 is highly similar to TtPT2 and HvPT2, two PHT1 family genes in T. aestivum/Thinopyrum intermedium and barley, respectively. TaPT2 is 1,802 bp long at the cDNA level; it encodes a 525-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 57.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.65. TaPT2 contains 12 conserved membrane-spanning domains and is transported to the cytosolic membrane after endoplasmic reticulum sorting. Functional complement analysis revealed that TaPT2 endowed Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant that is defective in Pi uptake, with high-affinity Pi acquisition. TaPT2 transcripts were specifically detected in the roots. The transcripts were upregulated under Pi deprivation and downregulated under Pi sufficiency. These results suggest that TaPT2 expression is associated with external Pi concentration. Transgene analysis revealed that TaPT2 overexpression or knockdown did not regulate plant dry mass production, Pi acquisition, and photosynthetic capacity under Pi sufficiency. Under Pi deprivation, TaPT2 overexpression increased plant dry mass accumulation, total P content per plant, and photosynthetic efficiencies, whereas TaPT2 downregulation reduced plant dry mass, accumulative P amount, and photosynthetic parameters. These results collectively suggest that TaPT2 is a high-affinity PHT1 member that has important functions in mediating plant Pi uptake under Pi deprivation. TaPT2 can serve as a useful gene resource for the improvement of phosphorus use efficiency in cereals under Pi deprivation. © 2014 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.',\n",

In this study, the expression patterns of 38 wheat microRNAs (TaMIRs) were investigated under normal N and low N stress. Under normal N conditions, the TaMIRs exhibited four expression patterns: high, moderate, low, and undetectable expression. Seven TaMIRs (TaMIR156, TaMIR399, TaMIR444, TaMIR1118, TaMIR1129, TaMIR1133, and TaMIR1136) showed varied expression levels under N deprivation. TaMIR156, TaMIR444, TaMIR1118, TaMIR1129, and TaMIR1136 were upregulated, whereas TaMIR399 and TaMIR1133 were downregulated. The expression patterns of TaMIR444, TaMIR1118, and TaMIR1129 were further analyzed under various low N concentrations and then returned to normal N. The aforementioned TaMIRs exhibited ever higher expression at lower N concentrations and whose expressions returned to those before low N stress after they were restored to normal N conditions, which suggest that N concentration and low N-duration are inversely correlated with their expression. The putative target genes of the low N–responsive TaMIRs were identified and categorized into various functional groups. Expression analysis revealed that the target genes showed opposite pattern to that of their corresponding TaMIRs. Our results suggested that some low N–responsive TaMIRs are involved in regulating plant response to N deprivation by interacting with their target genes. Distinct TaMIRs are potentially involved in plant tolerance to low N stress through microRNA-mediated pathways.',\n",

       " 'HmlONwqv': {'abstract': 'Aim: To observe the action of hydroxyanthroquinones from Rheum Palmatum L on reduced jaundice and enzyme in acute jaundice model of rat induced by ANIT. Methods: Wistar rats were randomized into five groups: group A in which no treatment was given, group B in which ANIT was given on the eighth day, group C in which high dosage of hydroxyanthroquinones from Rheum Palmatum L was given, group D in which low dosage of hydroxyanthroquinones from Rheum Palmatum L was given, group E in which \"Yinzhihuang injection\" was given as positive control. Except group A and B, other groups were given corresponding drugs for 7 days and then additionally administered ANIT to induce jaundice on the eighth day. Forty-eight hours later, the rats\\' blood was gained from eyes and the serum was separated. The liver functional sign, the activity of SOD, the content of MDA in serum and change in pathology of liver tissue were observed. Results: Compared to group B, ALT, AST, TBIL, ALP, γ-GT, MDA of group C and E descended obviously (P < 0.01), and SOD went up obviously (P < 0.01). By examining the liver pathology, we found that hepatic cellular change, necrosis and hepatominicholange hyperplasia could be notably alleviated in group C. Except that TBIL rose obviously (P < 0.01), the other signs of group C were not different from those of group E (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Hydroxyanthroquinones from Rheum Palmatum L has the action of reducing serum bilirubin and transaminase and improving liver tissue injury in rats of experimental Cholestasis.',\n",

       " 'fVGf4SmY': {'abstract': 'Objective: Neurogenic inflammation has been confirmed to exist in migraine by pathological research; therefore, it is necessary to deepen the understanding of related content on neurogenic inflammation in migraine, which is meaningful to guide the clinical research. Data Sources: A computer-based online search of PUBMED database was undertaken to identify related articles published in English between January 1995 and December 2005 with the key words of \"migraine, neurogenic inflammation\". Study Selection: The data were examined firstly, and the quotations of every article were looked over. Inclusive criteria: Articles correlated with the neurogenic inflammation involved in migraine. Exclusive criteria: Repeated search or Meta analytic articles. Data Extraction: Among the 97 collected articles, 29 ones were consistent with the inclusive criteria and 69 ones were out of date or repetitive. In the 29 inclusive articles, 17 ones involved in neuropeptide, 6 involved in inflammatory related factors, 1-related to cortical spreading depression, 2 involved in serotonin, 2 involved in endothelin and 1 involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid. Data Synthesis: The trigeminovascular theory is dominant in the pathogenesis of migraine, and neurogenic inflammation is the key element of it. Previous research has confirmed that neurogenic inflammation exist in migraine. Release of neuropeptide, mainly calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and neurokinin A and the following neurogenic inflammation are proposed to be the pathophysiogical foundation. Release of inflammatory factors such as β-transforming growth factor, interleukin-8, histamine and so on and increased activated platelet also participate in this course. Animal experiments have shown that cortical spreading depression and endothelin play important roles in rat dural neurogenic inflarnmation; 5-hydroxytryptamine',\n",
